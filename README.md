This is the repository for the website

## The original Quicksilver Wiki aka the Metaweb

In 2003 [Neal Stephenson](https://quicksilver.wiki/neal-stephenson) published [Quicksilver](https://quicksilver.wiki/quicksilver), the first
novel in his historical fiction series the [Baroque Cycle](https://quicksilver.wiki/stephenson-neal-baroque-cycle.md).

As part of this release, Stephenson set up a [wiki](https://quicksilver.wiki/metaweb-metaweb-introduction-neal-stephenson.md) with annotations and info on
the book. This wiki was edited both by Stephenson and community of readers.
Eventually it covered the second ([The Confusion](https://quicksilver.wiki/the-confusion)) and third
([The System of the World](https://quicksilver.wiki/the-system-of-the-world)) novels, both released in
2004, as well as a few other books.

The wiki — initially called Metaweb and later the [Quicksilver
Wiki](metaweb-site-renaming-patrick-tufts.md) — was active from 2003 to 2006,
but is no longer online except at the Internet Archive, which is cumbersome to
access.

## Reboot

*This* site is a mirror of the original Quicksilver Wiki — scraped from the
Internet Archive, converted into markdown, lightly processed and rendered using
[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

All internal links should work. Some images work.

Unfortunately, most external links *won't* work, even if they're still
active[^2].

[^2]: I accidentally wrecked most of them while parsing the markdown.
Eventually maybe I'll go back to the html and grab them again.

## Disclaimer

This site is unaffiliated with Neal Stephenson and the original Metaweb
project. I get no monetary value from it. I just:

1. like the Baroque Cycle
2. wanted to enhance my experience (re)reading it, and
3. thought others might be in similar situations

## Contributing

While the original Quicksilver Wiki was easy to edit, this version lives in a
this Github repository, and for now is only editable via pull requests, which
are welcome.
