# Ontology

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Ontology is the (philosophical) study of what is. That is to say,
it deals with questions of what things really exist in and of themselves - 
a very simple example is whether numbers actually exist, or are just... something else. This latter question addresses part of the ontology of (Philosophy of) Mathematics - another use of the word is as the noun for the accepted or stipulated "objects" of a subject.

Ontology is often confused with [metaphysics](/metaphysics), which the the study of the nature of what exists. Both tie closely with the question of [substance](/substance), an attributed posited to things that exist.
