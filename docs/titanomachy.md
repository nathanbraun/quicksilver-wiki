In Greek mythology, Titanomachy was the war between the Titans (fighting from Mt. Othrys) and the Olympians. It is also known as the Battle of Titans or Titan War. The war was foretold to Cronus by Gaia and Uranus because Cronus had refused to restore justice after his father was dethroned.

The Titans were led by Cronus and included: Oceanus, Coeus, Crius, Hyperion, Iapetus, Thia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, Tethys, Prometheus, Epimetheus, Atlas, Menoetius. The Olympians were led by Zeus and included: Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon, the Hecatonchires, the Gigantes and the Cyclopes.

Having won victory after ten years of war, the Olympians divided the spoils between themselves, granting dominion of the sky to Zeus, the sea to Poseidon, and the Underworld to Hades. They then shut the defeated Titans within Tartarus. However, since during the war the female titans (the titanesses: Thia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, and Tethys) remained neutral, they were not punished by Zeus. The Hecatonchires remained guard over them until, in time, Zeus set all but Atlas free.
