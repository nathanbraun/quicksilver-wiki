From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

**Praise God** was the eldest brother and the only other son of [Drake](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-drake-waterhouse) who, along with with his half-brother [Daniel](/daniel-waterhouse), still seemed to share their father's [puritan](/puritan) mindset. In Daniel's case, it is an evolving one.

He spent the [Civil War](/english-civil-war) and Restoration in the New World. He is the father of [Wait Still Waterhouse](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-wait-still-waterhouse)
