# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:811:Bonaventure Rossignol (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

[Rossignol](/bonaventure-rossignol) is a real historical figure, as was his father [Antoine](/antoine-rossignol). Some information about them may be found in David Kahn's *The Codebreakers*. But I have not been able to discover much in the way of detail and so virtually everything about him in these books is fictional. They did, however, live in a chateau at Juvisy.
