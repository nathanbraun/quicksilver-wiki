# Stephenson:Neal:The Confusion:142:Plateau of Satory (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

The Plateau of Satory really exists, as do the Pi√®ce d'eau des Suisses, the Potagerie, the Orangerie, and most of the other landmarks mentioned in this story, however, as mentioned elsewhere, La Dunette is fictitious. I believe that there is a Ste. Genevieve's in Versailles but the version of it depicted in this book is fictitious.
