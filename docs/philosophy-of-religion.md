# Philosophy of religion

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

There are three primary questions in the philosophy of religion:

Using existential quantification, how does one make a statement about:
1. how to make a statement about the existence of god;
2. how to make a statement about the existence of self;
3. how to make a statement about the relationship of self and god.


All this is prelude to a set of statements that can then be derived, if it is possible to do so.
