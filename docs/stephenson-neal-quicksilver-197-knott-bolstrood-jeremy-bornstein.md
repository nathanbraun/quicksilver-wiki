# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:197:Knott Bolstrood (Jeremy Bornstein)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

The footnote tells us that the king gave [Bolstrood](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-knott-bolstrood) the title Lord Penistone so that he would be unable to write his name without writing "penis." This childish humor seems consistent with the behavior of [Charles II](/charles-ii) but I have been unable to discover if he actually did grant this title to anyone nonfictional.
