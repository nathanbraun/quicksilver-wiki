From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

A spire of rock in or near [Qwghlm](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-qwghlm). [Outer Qwghlm](/outer-qwghlm) is dominated by three Sghrs, The seat of [Qwghlm's Ducal Family (Alan Sinder)](/qwghlm-s-ducal-family-alan-sinder) is on top of a fourth (smaller) [Sghr](/sghr).

The "Zeur" of [Eliza](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-eliza)'s title (Countess of Zeur) is a corruption of the non-native attempts to pronounce Sghr.
