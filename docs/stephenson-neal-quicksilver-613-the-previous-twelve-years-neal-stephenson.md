From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

The account of English history 1673-1685 given in this and following pages is faithful in its general outlines to what really happened, but many of the names mentioned, viz., [Daniel Waterhouse](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-daniel-waterhouse), [John Comstock](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-john-comstock), [Thomas More Anglesey](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-thomas-more-anglesey), [Knott](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-knott-bolstrood) and [Gomer Bolstrood](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-gomer-bolstrood), Upnor, Sheerness, [Roger Comstock](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-roger-comstock) and Sir [Richard Apthorp](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-richard-apthorp), are fictional characters. Events such as the [Popish Plot](/popish-plot), the urban renewal project around St. James's and Piccadilly, Exclusion, the founding of the Whigs, etc. really happened.
