# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:772:Sghr (Jeremy Bornstein)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

[Qwghlm](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-qwghlm) is a region of the British Isles composed of two islands. On this page, Eliza's letter names one as [Sghr](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-sghr), leading me to wonder what native name the other island might have. I suspect that this information is contained in [Cryptonomicon](/stephenson-neal-cryptonomicon), but I could not find it in [Quicksilver](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver).
