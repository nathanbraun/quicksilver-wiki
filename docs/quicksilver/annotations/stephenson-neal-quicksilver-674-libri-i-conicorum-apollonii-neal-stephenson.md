# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:674:LIBRI I. CONICORUM APOLLONII (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

This is from a 1655 edition of Apollonius of Perga, but in the original these illustrations do not all appear together in a block like this. Alvy Ray Smith created this graphic by propping the book up in a window with the sun shining on it and taking pictures of several different illustrations with a really good digital camera, then cleaning up and recombining the images digitally to produce what you see here.
