**BOSTON STATE HOUSE**

A blaze in 1711 destroyed the meeting house that once stood on the site, also burned a third of the town. It revolutionized the Old State House, which was constructed in 1713 to replace one destroyed by flames, was itself damaged by fires in 1748, 1832 and 1921. Later fires would not be be seen via the Puritan interpretation of fires as messages from an angry God. Enoch notes the signs the 1711 fire left on the remaining older buildings ...
