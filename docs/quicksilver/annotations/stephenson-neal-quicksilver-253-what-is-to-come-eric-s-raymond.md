# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:253:What is to come? (Eric S. Raymond)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

When Tom the Vagabond says lewdly "What is to *come?* I have spied one candidate--" he is committing an anachronism. The verb "to come" as a term for
for orgasm is a Victorian development, not well-attested until the 1890s. In period, Tom might have used the verb "to spend", but that would have ruined
the play on words.
