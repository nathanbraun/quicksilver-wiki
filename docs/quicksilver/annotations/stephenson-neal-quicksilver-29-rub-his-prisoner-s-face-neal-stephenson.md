# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:29:...rub his prisoner's face... (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Here as in many other places, the
approach taken is to present a fictionalized and somewhat
impressionistic account of a more or less genuine historical
event. The fight and the nose-rubbing are described in Westfall's
"Never at Rest," pp. 59-60 of my trade paperback edition. He traces
the story to Keynes who got it from [Newton's](/isaac-newton) relative and early
biographer Conduitt. It has been much written about and discussed, as
have several other elements of the tale I am re-telling in these
pages. I single this one passage out for annotation because at least
one early reader has gotten the idea, from the way I wrote it, that
the other boy's face was terribly mutilated. This was not the case in
the historical incident and is not supposed to be the case
here. Newton is a pre-adolescent boy, and can only inflict so much
damage on a larger child (who is, after all, fully conscious, and
fighting back) during the few moments that he has before
Justice arrives in the form of the Schoolmaster. From the fact that
his only punishment is a few cane-whacks and some after-school cleanup
work, we may infer that the other boy was not badly hurt. As anyone
who has been in a schoolyard fight knows, facial cuts bleed all out of
proportion to their actual severity and look much more alarming simply
because they are on the face. The victim has a bloody nose and some
abrasions but his "wrecked face" will no longer look wrecked once he
has splashed some water on it. The other boys are shocked, not because
some real mutilation is taking place, but because they have never seen
anyone with Newton's level of intensity before.
