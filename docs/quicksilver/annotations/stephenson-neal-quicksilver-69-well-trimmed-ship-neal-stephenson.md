# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:69:well-trimmed ship (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Now that we are on board a ship with
[Daniel](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-daniel-waterhouse), it's as good a place as any to mention that this is not a Ship
Novel. I was tempted to make it one, but bated because I knew at some
level that to plunge into that lore would make the book twice as long
even as it already was. Instead I have tried to put in enough Ship
stuff that the novel will hold water, as it were, but left detailed
Ship content to the many excellent novelists who specialize in that
sort of thing.
