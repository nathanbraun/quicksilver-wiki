# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:864:Glorious Revolution...Moment It All Happened (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Mashed together into one evening here are a good many fictitious and real events, including the return of [John Locke](/john-locke) to England and the arrest of [Jeffreys](/judge-jeffreys). Chalk it up to [literary license](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-17-oh-dear-alan-sinder).
