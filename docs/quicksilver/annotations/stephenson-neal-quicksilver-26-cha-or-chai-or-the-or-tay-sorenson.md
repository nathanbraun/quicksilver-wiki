From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

The first trade advertisement was actually the first advertisement of a new commodity, tea. The following advertisement appeared in the Mercurius Polilicus, No. 435, September 30, 1658, three years after Enoch brewed his tea in Grantham. 

"That excellent and by all Physitians approved China Drink, called by the Chineans Tcha, by other nations Tay, alias Tee, is sold at the Sultaness Head, a cophee-house in Sweetings Rents, by the Royal Exchange, London."
