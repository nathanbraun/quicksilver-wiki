### Euclid

 
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. 

**Euclid of Alexandria** (Greek: *Eukleides*) (circa 365 -275 BCE) was a Greek mathematician who lived in the 3rd century BCE in Alexandria. His most famous work is the ***Elements***, a book in which he deduces the properties of geometrical objects and integers from a set of axioms, thereby anticipating the axiomatic method of modern [mathematics](/mathematics). Although many of the results in the Elements originated with earlier mathematicians, one of Euclid's major accomplishments was to present them in a single logically coherent framework. The geometry of Euclid was known for ages as "the" geometry, but is nowadays referred to as **Euclidean geometry**. ![Euclid.jpg](/https://web.archive.org/web/20060725170331im_/http://www.metaweb.com/wiki/upload/2/21/Euclid.jpg)
