# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:92:The page ends abruptly. (Scott Elkin)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Is this page supposed to end abruptly?

>The next chapter is titled "The Plague Year"...think sudden flashback.

It's intended to be read continuously from the bottom of p. 92 to the top of 93, hence: "all of a sudden it's The Plague Year." Unfortunately the footnote breaks it up a bit.[Nealstephenson](/user-nealstephenson) 14:46, 12 Oct 2003 (PDT)
