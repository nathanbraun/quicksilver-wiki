From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

This is totally fictitious. Nothing like it ever existed. It is one of
the "hypotheses" upon which the "romance" is founded (see
[Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:1:Those who assume hypotheses...](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-1-those-who-assume-hypotheses-neal-stephenson)).

Yet isn't it a bit coincidental that its name could be shortened to Massachusetts Institute of Technology? Of course the real MIT wasn't founded until the mid 1800's. [http://web.mit.edu/facts/mission.html](/http-web-mit-edu-facts-mission-html)
