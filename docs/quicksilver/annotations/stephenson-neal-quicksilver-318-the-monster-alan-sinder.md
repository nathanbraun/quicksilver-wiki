*The late author [Gerald Kersh](/http-harlanellison-com-kersh-biog-htm) wrote of sentient automatia, as has [Tim Powers](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-tim-powers)  When the 26 year old [Daniel](/daniel-waterhouse) thinks of [Leibniz](/leibniz) as **Monstro** it almost conjures up the [Disney](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-walt-disney) Whale from [Pinnochio](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-pinocchio-1940-movie). Here be **monsters** is a mindset an older and wiser Daniel wants eliminated from maps...* ![PinocchiomonstroMW.jpg](/https://web.archive.org/web/20060725170706im_/http://www.metaweb.com/wiki/upload/f/f2/PinocchiomonstroMW.jpg)

### Monsters


It is likely [Leibniz](/gottfried-wilhelm-von-leibniz) is a **monster**  to many  in the sense of being beyond, or exceeding, the power or laws of nature; miraculous. Which means Daniel also views [Isaac Newton](/isaac-newton) in the same light. [Robert Anton Wilson](/robert-anton-wilson) had Sigismundo Celine AKA [Adam Weishaupt](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-adam-weishaupt) refer to [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-wolfgang-amadeus-mozart) as a **monster**. He should not be viewed as the hideous confrontational antagonist of fiction. Daniel knows real human monsters such as Upnor and Jeffreys, he just has turned a *blind eye* to them for the moment.

### The Dream Dictionary: Monster


Dreaming that you are followed by a monster means that grief and misfortune are in your immediate future. Monsters represent parts of yourself that you find brutish and ugly. You may possess some fears or some repressed emotions. Dreaming that you kill a monster means that you will successfully deal with your rivals and advance to a higher and better position.

### [Wikipedia: Monster](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-monster)


**Monster** (lat. monstrum) is a term for any number of legendary creatures that frequently appear in mythology, legend, and horror fiction. They are also a mainstay of role-playing and video games. "Monster" usually, but not always, implies that these creatures are larger than human size. It almost always implies that the creatures are powerful and hostile to the hero, and must be overcome to succeed in the quest.![Stgeorge-dragon.jpg](/https://web.archive.org/web/20060725170706im_/http://en.wikipedia.org/upload/9/97/Stgeorge-dragon.jpg)  
***Saint George versus the Dragon*  
*by Gustave Moreau, (1880)***

Occasionally, there are monsters who act out of legitimate motives and their monsterous appearance leads to serious misunderstandings. One well known example is the [Horta](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-horta) in the *[Star Trek](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-star-trek)* episode, "The Devil in The Dark". It is an ugly looking, but fully sentient rock like monster that could spray a powerful acid and was killing miners in the mines of a planet. However, when Capt. Kirk and Mr. Spock investigated the situation, they discovered that the creature was really desperately attempting to defend her young which were being inadvertantly killed by the miners. They inform the miners and a mutually beneficial agreement with the creature was reached to peacefully resolve the situation. 

Some well known monsters are:
* Bigfoot
* Bogeyman
* Cthulhu
* [Frankenstein](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-frankenstein)'s monster - [Jess Nevin](/http-listserv-indiana-edu-cgi-bin-wa-a2-ind0110e-l-victoria-t-0-f-s-p-3148)'s theories seem sound that the monster is a precursor to the *Yellow Peril* fear
* Godzilla (see Toho Studios; kaiju ) AKA Gojira
	+ Gamera
	+ Mothra
	+ Rodan
* Gorgon
	+ Medusa
* Grendel
* Hydra
* Jabberwocky
* King Kong
* Loch Ness monster
* Roc
* Scylla & Charybdis
* Sphinx
* Tarasque

**Fourth Doctor played  
by Tom Baker**


It's not beyond the wit of certain British writers to invoke [The Doctor](/leibniz) as a precursor to **[Doctor Who](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-doctor-who)** the British science fiction television series, produced by the BBC and concerning the adventures of a mysterious time-travelling adventurer known only as 'The Doctor'. It is also the title of a 1996 television movie featuring the same character. The program was and remains a significant part of British popular culture, widely recognised for its creative storytelling, use of innovative music which was produced by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, and low-budget special effects. The show has become a cult television favourite on par with Star Trek, and has influenced generations of British genre television writers, many of whom grew up watching the series. In a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes of the 20th century drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted for by industry professionals, Doctor Who was placed third. A new series of Doctor Who television episodes is being produced by the BBC. It is scheduled to broadcast on BBC One in Spring 2005.

### Wikipedia: Monster group



In [mathematics](/mathematics), the **Monster group** M is a [group](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-group-mathematics) of order
   246 · 320 · 59 · 76 · 112 · 133 · 17 · 19 · 23 · 29 · 31 · 41 · 47 · 59 · 71 
 = 808017424794512875886459904961710757005754368000000000
 ≈ 8 · 1053.

It is a [simple group](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-group-mathematics), meaning it does not have any [normal subgroups](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-normal-subgroup) except for the subgroup consisting only of the identity element, and *M* itself. Despite the name, simple groups are far from "simple". The finite simple groups are important because in a certain sense they are the "basic building blocks" of all finite groups, somewhat similar to the way [prime numbers](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-prime-number) are the basic building blocks of the [integers](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-integer). This is expressed by the [Jordan-Hölder theorem](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-jordan-hölder-theorem).

The only simple groups which are [abelian](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-abelian-group) are the [cyclic groups](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-cyclic-group) whose order is a prime number. In a huge collaborative effort, the [classification of finite simple groups](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-classification-of-finite-simple-groups) was accomplished in 1982. 

The [Monster](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-dimension-mathematical-dimensions) was found by B. Fischer and R. Griess in 1973. It can be constructed as a group of rotations in a space of [dimension](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-dimension) 196,883 over the [rational numbers](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-rational-number).

The Monster group prominently features in the [http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/98legacy/08-19-1998a.html [Monstrous Moonshine conjecture](/http-www-berkeley-edu-news-media-releases-98legacy-08-19-1998a-html) which relates discrete and non-discrete mathematics and was proven by Richard Borcherds in 1989. 

### Richard Borcherds


**Richard Ewen Borcherds** (born November 29, 1959) is a mathematician specializing in group theory and Lie algebras. He was born in Cape Town and educated at Cambridge University, where he studied under John Horton Conway. After receiving his doctorate he has held various positions at Cambridge and at the University of California, Berkeley, where he is currently a professor of mathematics. 

Borcherds is best known for his work connecting the theory of finite groups with other areas in mathematics. In particular he invented the notion of vertex algebras, which he used to prove the Conway-Norton conjecture. This is related to representation theory of the monster group, a very large finite simple group whose structure was previously not well-understood. 

He was made a Fellow of the [Royal Society](/royal-society) in 1994, and also received the John Whitehead Prize from the London Mathematical Society and the Prize of the Society of Paris in 1992. Borcherds was awarded the Fields Medal in 1998. 

The Monstrous Moonshine conjecture provides an interrelationship between the Monster Group and modular functions. Modular functions are used in modeling structures in two dimensions, and can be helpful, for example, in the description of molecular structures. The Monster Group, in contrast, seemed to be of importance only to pure mathematicians.  In his proof, Borcherds uses many ideas of string theory - a surprisingly fruitful way of making theoretical physics useful for mathematical theory. Although still the subject of dispute among physicists, strings offer a way of explaining many of the puzzles surrounding the origins of the universe. They were proposed in the search for a single consistent theory which brings together various partial theories of cosmology. Strings have a length but no other dimension and may be open strings or closed loops. [[1]](/http-www-berkeley-edu-news-media-releases-98legacy-08-19-1998a-html)
