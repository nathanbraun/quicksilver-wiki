# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:476:Damplatz (Neville Kuyt)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

This part of Amsterdam was and is in fact known as "de Dam"; it is still there, and is considered the center of town. Many kinds of commerce still take place on and near it, though their nature has changed to accomodate our modern tastes...

For a native Dutch reader of Quicksilver, encountering "Damplatz" is a real disappointment, as the word "platz" is so obviously wrong. The use of "plein" or "plaats" (place) instead of "platz" would have been much better, although it is usually called just "de Dam".

Also refer to the (correct) use of "Plein" in The Hague
