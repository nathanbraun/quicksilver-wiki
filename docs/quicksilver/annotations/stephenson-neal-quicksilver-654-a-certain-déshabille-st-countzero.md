# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:654:a certain déshabille (St.CountZero)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

"déshabille" (muted final -e) is a conjugated form (first and third person singular, present tense) of the verb "déshabiller" (final -e pronounced, like "ay"), to undress. The word for a light feminine garment would be "déshabillé" (also "ay"), derived from the past participle form of the same verb.
