# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:195:Comstock House (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

There were at the time at least three great family
compounds situated along Piccadilly near its intersection with
St. James's Street. One of these belonged to the Earl of Clarendon,
who is one of several contemporary figures from whom [John Comstock](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-john-comstock) is
freely adapted. The only one that still exists today is Burlington
House, which is now the [Royal Academy](/royal-academy).
