# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:18:...heard by their future Queen... (Chris Swingley)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

The Act of Settlement in 1701 set Sophia of Hanover (a Protestant) as the next in the line of succession after [Queen Anne](/queen-anne) in order to prevent James III (a [Catholic](/catholic)) from becoming King. They spoke German, and the eventual successor to Queen Anne, [George I](/george-i-of-england), never even learned English.
