# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:8:King Carlos the Sufferer(Alan Sinder)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

In an impromptu history lesson, young [Ben Franklin](/ben-franklin) tells [Enoch Root](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-enoch-root) about sick Carlos II of Spain. It is in the "bloody" buildup to of all this, that the picaresque adventures of [Eliza](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-eliza) and [Half cocked Jack](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-jack-shaftoe)  the "King" of the Vagabonds  occur in a sort of extended Continental vacation starting September 12, 1683.
