# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:921:Cromwell, Roger...(Alan Sinder)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

A typo, I suspect, confusing Richard with Roger Comstock.

Somehow [Richard Cromwell](/richard-cromwell) AKA **Tumbledown Dick** has been renamed *Roger*.

This is present in the UK edition of the book.
