From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

The **[Massachusetts Bay Colony Institute of Technologickal Arts](/massachusetts-bay-colony-institute-of-technologickal-arts)** is not entirely unlike the modern-day Massachusetts Institute of Technology. MIT, however, was incorporated much later (1861). Future archaelogists will undoubtedly discover the ruins of [Dr. Waterhouse's](/daniel-waterhouse) cabin near a steam tunnel running beneath the Infinite Corridor.
