# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:22:Â…anointed him with angelbalm, a thousand years old (Alan Sinder)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.


The specific reference here is to the Oil of Clovis with which all pre-Revolutionary French kings were anointed during their coronation. Legendarily, the vial was supposed to have been delivered in the beak of a heaven-sent dove to the bishop who baptised [Clovis](/clovis), the first Frankish king, in 496 A.D. [Richard Johnston]
