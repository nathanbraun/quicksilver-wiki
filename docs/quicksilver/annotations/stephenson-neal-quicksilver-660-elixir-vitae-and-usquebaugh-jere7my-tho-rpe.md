From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

*Elixir Vitae* is the ultimate goal of alchemists and the imputed contents of the Philosopher's Stone, capable of granting eternal life and transmuting base metals into gold. Literally translated, it means "elixir [potion] of life".

*Usquebaugh* is whisky (from Gaelic, "uisge beatha"). Literally translated, it means "water of life".

Roger was making a cross-language pun: i.e., Daniel accused Isaac of drinking the elixir of life, so Roger pointed out that Daniel had himself been drinking the water of life.
