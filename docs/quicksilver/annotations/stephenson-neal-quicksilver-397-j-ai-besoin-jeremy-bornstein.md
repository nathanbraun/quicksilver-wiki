# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:397:J'ai besoin... (Jeremy Bornstein)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Translating French to English, the bottom of this page reads:

 "I need a jug," Jack offered.

 Eliza was amused. "Jack, we're in Bohemia! Why are you speaking French?"

 "There are some in that cellar over there, sir," said the peasant.

 "Thanks."

 "You're welcome, sir."
