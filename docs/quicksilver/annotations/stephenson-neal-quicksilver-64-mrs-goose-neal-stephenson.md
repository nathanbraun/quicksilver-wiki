# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:64:Mrs. Goose (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

There was a Mrs. Goose in Boston. Her gravestone stands in the
Granary Burying Ground. It is by no means clear that she is THE
Mrs. Goose responsible for the [Mother Goose](/mother-goose) stories. Other people, who
lived earlier, seem to have a claim on that honor.
