# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:15:Daniel Waterhouse (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Waterhouse is a reasonably common English
name. The [Waterhouses](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-waterhouse-family), both here and in [Cryptonomicon](/stephenson-neal-cryptonomicon), are totally
fictitious and bear no relationship whatsoever to any real people
named Waterhouse anywhere in the world. [Daniel Waterhouse](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-daniel-waterhouse) has one or
two things in common with a John Wickins who was [Newton](/isaac-newton)'s roommate at
Cambridge, but beyond that he is completely fictitious (as are the
other Waterhouses) and there is no point trying to search historical
documents for anyone of that name.
