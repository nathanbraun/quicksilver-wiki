# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:520:Spij (Sander van Malssen)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Modern-day travelers to the Hague who wish to retrace our heroes' footsteps should know that the canal referred to here is called *Spui* in modern spelling, or *Spuij* in somewhat older spelling, or *Spuy* in the most probable spelling of the times in which this story takes place. I sincerely regret to report that, despite the vagaries of Dutch spelling of the time, *Spij* is not an acceptable spelling for this canal's name in any period of time whatsoever.


Modern-day travelers to the Hague who wish to *literally* retrace our heroes' footsteps should be warned that it is *on no account* advisable to try and skate over the Spui these days as it was filled in about a 100 years ago and is now populated by trams. It is important to know in this context that trams in the Netherlands are not subject to any legal speed limits.
