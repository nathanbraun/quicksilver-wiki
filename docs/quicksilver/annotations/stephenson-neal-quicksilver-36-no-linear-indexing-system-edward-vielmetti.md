# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:36:No linear indexing system (Edward Vielmetti)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Waterhouse's system for organizing his notecards appears to prefigure Ranganathan's faceted classification or "colon classification" system. Both allow for composite classifications to be built up out of a product of simpler categories, and allow for an infinite number of possible results (as long as there's space on the card or spine of the book).
