# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:150:Newton at Woolsthorpe (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

The things that Newton is shown working on and thinking about
in this chapter tally pretty well with history. What is different, of
course, is the insertion of the fictional character [Daniel Waterhouse](/daniel-waterhouse),
who gets to observe and (a little) participate.
