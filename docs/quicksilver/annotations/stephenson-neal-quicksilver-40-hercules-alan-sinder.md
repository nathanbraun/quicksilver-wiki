From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

This is the [Quicksilver](/quicksilver) page for **Hercules**
### Stephensonia


*This is the 2nd time we catch [Enoch Root](/enoch-root) discussing [Heracles](/heracles) with a member of the [Waterhouse family](/waterhouse-family); though it may be the first chronologically. Is it poetic for 'probable '[Deists](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-deist) *like Enoch and [Daniel](/daniel-waterhouse) to talk of pagan mythology?**

### Announcing A Quest


The *[gallow's humor](/leibniz-and-black-humor-alan-sinder)* we're hearing from Daniel and Enoch isn't a macho thing. And we know that many have planned for Daniel odder [tasks](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-99-end-of-days-alan-sinder) such as his father who wanted Daniel to speak to ***King Jesus*** in Aramaic when He arrived at the cliffs of Dover. It is more resignation than resolution. Amazing how effective the right bribe is.
