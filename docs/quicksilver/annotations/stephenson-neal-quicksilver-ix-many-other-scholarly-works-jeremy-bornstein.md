# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:ix:Many other scholarly works (Jeremy Bornstein)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

It might be nice to create a [Quicksilver Reference Bibliography](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-reference-bibliography) to list some of the scholarly works that are mentioned by the author here.

I will do this when things calm down a little bit, but it might not happen for a couple of weeks.[Nealstephenson](/user-nealstephenson) 10:56, 6 Oct 2003 (PDT)

Update: now I am going to try doing it a few books at a time, as time permits.[Nealstephenson](/user-nealstephenson) 11:02, 31 Oct 2003 (PST)

Note that a good start to get to know some of the non-fiction background to the Baroque cycle are: 
Science: A History 1543-2001 (John Gribbin, 2002; Penguin)
The Invisible College (Robert Lomas, 2002; Headline)
