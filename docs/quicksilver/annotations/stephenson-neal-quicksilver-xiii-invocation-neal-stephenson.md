# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:xiii:Invocation (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

This poem has nothing to do with the book's subject
matter. It is a very old tradition to invoke the
[Muse](/muse). I think it is a way for the author to express his or her sense
of utter helplessness at the hands of whatever circumstances, humors,
moods, or what-have-you make it possible for writing to take
place. The Muse theory is very old but makes as much sense as any more
modern explanation, and so I thought it wouldn't hurt, and might
help.
