# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:25:Clarke (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Clarke really existed, and [Newton](/isaac-newton) really lived with him. The
account here is mostly fictionalized but stiffened here and there with
historical evidence. See Richard Westfall's "Never at Rest.", [ISBN 0521274354](/).
