# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:400:Winston Churchill (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Obviously not he of 20th Century fame,
however there really was a Winston Churchill at this time, and most of
what is said about him in this novel tallies reasonably well with such
historical material is available. Most of that comes from his
namesake's six-volume biography of Marlborough (Winston Churchill's
son John) which is very much an axe-grinder and so might be looked at
askance by other historians.
