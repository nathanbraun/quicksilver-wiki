# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:10:D.G. HISPAN ET IND REX (Alan Sinder)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

As [Enoch](/enoch-root) ponders about the universal currency of the new 18th century -- he examines a "Spanish" silver coin marked "**D.G. HISPAN ET IND REX**" (*Deo gratia Hispaniae et Indiarum Rex*, "By the grace of God, king of Spain and the [Indies](/indies)") that he identifies as "a piece of eight." Universal currency was 'octal' and as such the Piece of Eight was clearly marked with the number "8" -- and for a while even the U.S. Dollar would have 8 pie slices. "2 bits" was a quarter to the parents of the "Baby Boomers." Therefore, the coin fingered by Enoch was an 8 reale coin cut in half.
