# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:146:the western horizon (Armaced)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

*Daniel found that he was walking directly towards a blazing planet, a few degrees above the western horizon, which could only be Venus. Â… The dawn was making the fields shimmer pink and green.*

This is most likely a typo, for if it was dawn Venus would appear in the eastern sky, near the sun.
