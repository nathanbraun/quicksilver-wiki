From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Confusing moment arose as this section was read. What historical basis is there to have the Defender of The Faith being involved in the desperate, explosive efforts to save sections of London from fire?

Perhaps this was a moment of whimsy, as the image of the King personally blowing up a dissident cleric is amusing in its way.

No, there is a historical basis for it somewhere, which I unfortunately do not have time to track down just now, as I am embroiled in promotional activities. It is too weird for me to have made up. In a few weeks I'll try to figure out where I got this and post the source.[Nealstephenson](/user-nealstephenson) 20:51, 10 Oct 2003 (PDT)

I have found reference to the King personally being involved in the fighting of the fire. I summarize from Will Durant's The Story of Civilization VIII;

"In this crisis both the King and and his brother James labored with thier own hands among the firefighters, directing and financing relief, providing food and shelter and, against much opposition, blowing up houses to stop the progress of the fire (perhaps saving part of the city north of the Thames).
