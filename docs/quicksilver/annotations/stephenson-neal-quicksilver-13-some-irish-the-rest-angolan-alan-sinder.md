# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:13:Some Irish, the rest Angolan... (Alan Sinder)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

A travel tired [Enoch Root](/enoch-root) arrives in New York in time for a slave revolt. Some of the slaves were Irish, the rest Angolan.  A global famine had started in 1707, forcing many luckless Irish into a life of slavery. One must think the decision of the Pennsylvania Assembly must have terrified many. [Daniel Waterhouse](/daniel-waterhouse) also notes the rowing dirge of the slaves on the pilot boat contains Irish elements to it. Suspect the [Barkers](/barker) caused this New York city riot.
