(Redirected from [Faction](/faction))

A **faction** is a group of co-operating users who can sometimes conspire against, as opposed to always executing the instructions of, the administrators. It's roughly analogus to a political party, and puts the administrators in the position of being bureaucrats executing a due process.

*Note that [GetWiki](/getwiki) and [Mediawiki](/mediawiki) software themselves create several factions simply by assigning user roles, those being [Metaweb:sysops](/metaweb-sysops), [Metaweb:developers](/metaweb-developers), and the [Metaweb:vandals](/metaweb-vandals) they [block IP](/block-ip) of, and [Metaweb:trolls](/metaweb-trolls) they sometimes propose formal processes or features "for".*

A closely related concept is that of the [phyle](/phyle) from [Diamond Age](/diamond-age). It may be more appropriate given the [Stephensonia](/stephensonia) focus of metaweb to talk in terms of [Metaweb:phyles](/metaweb-phyle) than factions. That would let Neal say what they are, and vary from the concept of a faction as it is evolving on other wikis.

Since both the faction and the phyle are those who assume high trust within the group, but are not necessarily accorded any trust beyond absolute minimum by those outside the group, it's an alternative to a [permission-based model](/permission-based-model), and one more likely to encourage the kind of wide participation a [large public wiki](/large-public-wiki) thrives on.

See [Recyclopedia:faction](/http-www-recyclopedia-info-wiki-wiki-phtml-title-recyclopedia-faction) for a discussion of these potentials. **Faction** capabilities are one of several features for managing [identity dispute](/identity-dispute) problems, collective identity, alleged identity, an [interwiki identity standard](/interwiki-identity-standard) and a [standard wiki URI](/standard-wiki-uri). 

See also [Consumerium:faction](/http-consumerium-org-wiki-wiki-phtml-title-faction) for a discussion of how factions may apply in that model.
