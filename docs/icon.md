 Icon 
A beeing coming from a lower plane of existance than a personified AND executed [Sephira](/sephira) (an [Angelina](/)), but of higher level of [abstraction](/) than a simple [human](/) [person](/). An [Icon](/) is a complex [entity](/entity) ([entex](/entex)) consisting of a [collection](/) of such [objects](/wikipedia-object) as a [human body](/) with it's associated [human mind](/human-mind) executed on a [human brain](/) with a strong attachement to a [memeplex](/memeplex) dense information peripherial cloud powered with [mana](/mana) streams [generated](/) by the [influence](/) of [media providers](/media-provider) selecting content from [media content providers](/media-content-provider) through the [media](/media) of various sorts and levels of [abstraction](/), on [media receivers](/media-receiver) ([people](/wictionary-people)) AND retroactive influence of those people expressed in the various forms of [media](/media) (**possibility of a possitive resonnance inductive loop!**), LIKE [moving pictures](/), [magazines](/), [comics](/), [TV](/), [radio](/), [books](/), [paintings](/), [songs](/), [poems](/) AND of course, [World Wide Wait](/), [passive digital media](/passive-digital-media), [interactive digital media](/interactive-digital-media), [collaborative writing media](/collaborative-writing-media) (like [metaweb](/metaweb-metaweb) OR [WikiPedia](/) and myriad of different sort of [blogs](/)). An [Icon](/icon) cannot be separated from a real being on the level of abstraction of the [metaverse](/metaverse). If you are **in** the [metaverse](/metaverse), **the [Icon](/icon) is more real than the [Real World](/real-world) person part of it!** The associated [memeplex](/memeplex) can be also one OR more [Daimonions](/daimonion) OR other entities processing the [narrative](/narrative) describing the life of an [Icon](/metaweb-icon). An [Icon](/icon) can have a [narrative](/narrative) [altering](/) [force](/) of a [thermonuclear blast](/) and live happily sustaining its influence long after the death of the hosting OR attached human person with its associated [mind](/), though one might imagine an [Icon](/icon) consisting of all the [memes](/meme) plus a [human mind](/human-mind) simulated as a software process, a complex closed software object system modelled on a complex closed biological object system, a [sentient entity](/sentient-entity), a [person](/person) with [no body](/no-body). [grok](/grok)?
