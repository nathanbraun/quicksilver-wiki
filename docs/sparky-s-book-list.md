### Recommendations by others


The New World by Frederick Turner
[Future Primitive](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-future-primitive), anthology edited by Kim Stanley Robinson, containing many good authors Kim and me like
Mars series by Robinson (Red Mars etc.)
 * I read the first two of the Mars books -- I'm looking for the others, Scarce in Japan. :(
The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, Robert Heinlein
 * I remember having to kick myself from the book to look up 'undulate' -- Everyone misses 'Mike' -- and I got fascinated by "Sherlock Holmes" bc of that book.
The Dispossessed by Ursula LeGuin (and probably all her short stories too)
 * Thanks to a strange series of classes given by Harlan Ellison -- I was in an elevator with Ursula, Kathryn Knight, Leigh Brackett, and Dorothy Persheria(sp?) -- and I asked her about her dad and Ishii; Though, it was her mom who wrote "Ishii, Last of his Tribe" - the last unassimilated Californian natiive. 
Hyperion, by Dan Simmons, most compelling portrayal of AIs anywhere
 * Dan used be a regular at **Dangerous Visions Bookstore** - the odd child of **Change of Hobbit** in Sherman Oaks California.
Dune, by Frank Herbert, right to the end (sixth book really quite rules)
 * I was mystified by the *Face Dancers* as well.
Oryx and Crake, Margaret Atwood (very new, [http://www.oryxandcrake.co.uk](/http-www-oryxandcrake-co-uk) )
 * You'll have to sell me on Atwood. 
ANYTHING by Damon Knight, a marvellous author often unrightfully overlooked
 * Damon Knight is always a jolly read; his wife has written some good mysteries and SF

### Explanations


BTW - It's StSparky as I live in Santa Monica when in the States; Calling myself SMSparky recieved some marked odd results.  

[Cryptonomicon](/cryptonomicon) has effortlessly now blended with Pattern Recognition. Both have blended oddly well with the Kasuo Mori detective books I've read. And it's *NOW*. What's really odd is I've just read Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sir Nigil and The White Company and the Plague of 1348 he describes helped me make sense of the events in Quicksilver. 

I just finished Giles Milton's The Riddle and the Knight,Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe's Regiment and Robert Lomas's The Invisible College and Baudolino is being read now. Soon to be followed by George Dyson's Project Orion, Kim Stanley Robinson's The Years of Rice and Salt, and Dava Sobel's Galileo's Daughter.

Those are finished. 
Also devoured:: Dava Sobel's Longitude, Laura Joh Rowland's Mysteries, Bruce Sterling's Holy Fire, Stephen Hawking's The Theory of Everything, Thomas Disch's The Prisoner, Simon Winchester's The Professor and the Madman.

Finishing: JP Kenyon's Stuart England, HAL Fisher's The History of Europe vol.2

Bought: Claire Tomalin's Samuel Pepys: The Unequaled Self, John Gribben's Science: A History, Stephen Hawking's, On the Shoulders of Giants.

On order from Amazon Japan:
Have Space Suit-Will Travel
Glory Road  which I want to compare to Neverwhere: A Novel (I've a theory to compare Heinlein's [Podkayne of Mars](/http-www-amazon-co-jp-exec-obidos-asin-0709071396-qid-1073631762-sr-1-22-ref-sr-1-2-22-250-0112413-1501025) / Alexei and Cory Panshin's [Rite of Passage](/http-www-amazon-com-exec-obidos-tg-detail-0441727859-ref-lpr-g-2-103-8140691-3696657-v-glance-s-ebooks) against the two. Then again - folks may not like Panshin's take on RAH).
And these two:  Tanner's Tiger (An Evan Tanner Suspense Thriller) and Me Tanner, You Jane because Lawrence Block is fun. 

Found a copy of HG Wells World History! He's not a jingoist like HAL Fisher.

  Mary Renault wrote in her Introduction to the Pan 1975 version of Sir Nigil that there was a real person with the name, which Sir Arthur does not inform us of, known as Sir Neil or Sir Nigil Loring.   

  Anthony Burgess makes the observation that Sir Arthur's writing might not be a literary triumph but is at least a Shakespearian one.
