### [Wikipedia: Grok](/)


**Grok** is a [slang](/) verb roughly meaning "to understand completely" or more formally [intuitive understanding](/). It is primarily used by [geeks](/) and some [Pagans](/), particularly those belonging to the [Church of All Worlds](/) but is attested more widely.

The term originated in [Robert Heinlein](/)'s novel *[Stranger in a Strange Land](/)*, where it is part of the fictional [Martian](/) language and introduced to [English](/) speakers by a man raised by Martians. In the Martian tongue, it literally means "to drink" but is used in a much wider context.

A character in the novel (not the primary user) defines it: 

"*Grok* means to understand so thoroughly that the observer becomes a part of the observed—to merge, blend, intermarry, lose identity in group experience. It means almost everything that we mean by religion, philosophy, and science—and it means as little to us (because we are from Earth) as color means to a blind man."
