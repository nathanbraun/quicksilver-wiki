### Captain van Hoek


Operator of a very high tech ship, Captain van Hoek amusingly possesses an interchangable prosthesis which is normally a hook. He can be mistaken for a stout boy of ten so he must be short of stature. He *might* be a Dutch byblow of the wee [Charles I](/charles-i-of-england) and thus the inspiration for the pirate "Captain Hook.[1](/http-en2-wikipedia-org-wiki-charles-i-of-england)" Which is rather ironic as he is a captain with very anti-pirate views forged some 20 years earlier. ***1690** was the start of the Golden Age of Piracy according to some; Many more feel The Treaty of [Utrecht](/utrecht) in 1713 started it. Those nations who did sign the treaty were promising not to charter 'privateers.'*

I don't know which Sinbad movie I modified this image from - sorry**
His anti-pirate mindset is shared by his strangely literate and math savvy multi-national crew. With his first mate [Dappa](/dappa), he is capable of multi-layered bluffing strategies. Such bluffing the enemy first recorded in the English Privateer Drake's raids upon the Spanish.

We learn more on him in [The Confusion](/the-confusion); and [Jack Shaftoe](/jack-shaftoe) gets to call him a *red-headed stepchild*. He knows [Enoch Root](/enoch-root).

### Quotes


 " ... he nailed his colors to the mast 20 years ago." [Quicksilver](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver) Page 148. 
Nailing the colors to the mast is a traditional sign of defiance, indicating that the colors will never be struck, the ship will never surrender.[2](/http-www-history-navy-mil-trivia-trivia03-1-htm)
