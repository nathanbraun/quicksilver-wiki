# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:21:John Comstock and Thomas More Anglesey (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

These names are both
factitious and the characters both fictional. Don't bother Googling
them. [John Comstock](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-john-comstock) has a few things in common with John Evelyn (an
early [Royal Society](/royal-society) figure and author of a great Diary) and a
few other things in common with the Earl of Clarendon. [Thomas More Anglesey](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-thomas-more-anglesey) is not based that directly on any historical figures, but
stands in for a lot of Francophilic crypto-Catholic courtiers who were
thick on the ground in those days.
