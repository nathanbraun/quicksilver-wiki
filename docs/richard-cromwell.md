**[Oliver Cromwell](/oliver-cromwell)** and the army emerged as the power in the land. Cromwell dissolved parliament with the words "Depart I say, and let us have done with you. In the name of God , go!" It was the start of England's only period of dictatorship Cromwell was unable to find anything to replace the monarchy. When he died in 1658 his son Richard suceeded him, but "Tumbledown Dick" was not a man to rule Britain, and in 1660 [Charles II](/charles-ii) was restored to the throne his father had died for.

### Richard Cromwell


Wikipedia 

**Richard Cromwell** (October 4, 1626- July 12, 1712) was the third son of Oliver Cromwell, and was Lord Protector of England, Scotland and Ireland, from September 3, 1658 until May 25, 1659. Richard Cromwell's enemies called him Tumbledown Dick. 

Richard was an unlikely successor, coming to prominence only because his two elder brothers both died before their father. Having previously sat in parliament, but only having joined the Council of State a year before his appointment as Protector, he had neither the political experience nor the interest required to maintain his position. He gave it up with little hesitation, resigning or "abdicating" after a demand by the Rump Parliament. This was the beginning of a short period of restoration of the Commonwealth of England but led to a state of anarchy that resulted in the return of the exiled King Charles II of England and the English Restoration. Unlike his father, Richard was not held accountable for the death of King Charles I. He retired to obscurity, going into exile on the Continent under the soubriquet of "John Clarke", but returning in 1680 to live out the remainder of his life in Britain.
