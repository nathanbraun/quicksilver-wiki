# Stephenson:Neal:The Confusion:144:La Dunette (Joel Finkle)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

According to the book, "La Dunette" means the poop deck of a boat. Up until this time, I assumed it was meant to refer to the duc de Arcachon's home property, and be a reminder that it was a small version of his demense: Arcachon is known for its sand dunes, to wit: [A tourism page](/http-www-a2bis-com-aabis-english-sommaire-baywater-edune-htm) featuring the great dune at Pyla, highest in Europe.
