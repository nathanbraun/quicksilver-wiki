# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:688:Theologians? Sorcerers? (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

This account may be justly criticized for making [Newton](/isaac-newton) seem a little wacky. In future volumes we will see more of Newton's side of the story and get a more balanced view of all this. In modern critical parlance, [Daniel Waterhouse](/daniel-waterhouse) is an "unreliable narrator." We are seeing everything here through Daniel's eyes, but his eyes are clouded by his hostility towards [Alchemy](/alchemy), and so the picture drawn here is biased and melodramatic.
