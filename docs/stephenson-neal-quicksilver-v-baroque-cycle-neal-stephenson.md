# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:v:Baroque Cycle (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Why Baroque? Because it is set in the
Baroque, and it IS [baroque](/baroque). Why Cycle? Because I am trying to avoid the
T-word ("trilogy"). In my mind this work is something like 7 or 8 connected
novels. These have been lumped together into three volumes because it
is more convenient from a publishing standpoint, but they could just
as well have been put all together in a single immense volume or
separated into 7 or 8 separate volumes. So to slap the word "trilogy"
on it would be to saddle it with a designation that is essentially
bogus.

Having said that, I know everyone's going to call it a trilogy anyway.
