# Empathy

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

**Empathy** is feeling "along with" another person. If someone's views seem extreme to you, or unexpected, or whatever, try to put yourself in their shoes before dismissing them. 

Some believe empathy is the basis of all wisdom, and some go further and say it is the basis of all intelligence. In this view, robots and computers cannot be intelligent, since they do not feel empathy. At least, not for things with bodies like ours.
