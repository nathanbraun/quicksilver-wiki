# Rising of the Lights


Some identify Rising of the Lights as an obsolete name for Croup. Lights is an archaic term for lungs. Others maintain that it (as well as [La Suette Anglaise](/http-www-metaweb-com-wiki-wiki-phtml-title-la-suette-anglaise)) have not been clinically identified and therefore cannot be equated to current disease names. 

In any case, Rising of the Lights was listed as the cause of death of 397 people in London in 1665. [The Significance of Microbes as Causes of Disease in the U.K.](/http-www2-ntu-ac-uk-life-sh-modules-hlf349-lectures-349-1-htm)
