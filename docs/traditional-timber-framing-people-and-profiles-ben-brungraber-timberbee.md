# Traditional Timber Framing:People And Profiles:Ben Brungraber (Timberbee)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

[Ben Brungraber](/http-www-smithsonianmag-si-edu-smithsonian-issues02-apr02-images-timber-ben-brungraber-jpg-html). Ben has been, and still is a dynamic element of the Bensonwood team. Famous in the community for his "Stress Tests" as well as his humor, insights, and tremendous energy. A debate with Ben, no matter what side of the issue you find yourself on, is as delightful as it is challenging. I have nothing but respect for this man.

[Bensonwood's Team](/http-www-bensonwood-com-company-meetus-benbrungraber-html) shows the man on his feet.
