# Action at a distance (John Doe)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Action at a distance presupposes a unified field theory where mind and matter are intimately interconnected.In order to prove that this is so,simply concentrate your attention on anything in your mind,while sincerely desiring for it to come into being-and it will! Be careful,though. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Whatever you intend into being should idealy be in harmony and balance with ALL THAT IS.If you have any question about how appropriate what you intend into being may be, look within. The EYE OF THE HEART is an organ of perception which always sees the wholeness of things in relationship to what you are about to intend and will inform you of it's relative degree of balance and harmony with ALL THAT IS.
