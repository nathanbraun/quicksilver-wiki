# Talk:Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:772:Sghr (Jeremy Bornstein)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

To say "Qwghlm is a region of the British Isles composed of two islands" is misleading, since it is fictuous as Stephenson says in several places: [Qwghlm](/qwghlm)

As far as the names are concerned, the two parts are [Inner Qwghlm](/inner-qwghlm) and [Outer Qwghlm](/outer-qwghlm). [Sghr](/sghr) is just a great rock in or near Qwghlm.


Given that this entry is mostly personal musing, and that the part that is information is misleading and/or wrong, why is it a protected page?

The article is **authored** - so comments are posted on the associated Talk page. - [Sparky](/user-stsparky) 18:14, 2005 Jan 11 (PST)
