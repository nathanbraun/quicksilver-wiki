### Data Havens


A **[data haven](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-data-haven)** is a computer or network that holds data protected by both technical means (ie: encryption ) as well as legal means -- typically, being located in a sovereign nation with no extradition laws, and with no or poorly enforced laws against the most common uses of data havens:
* free (political) speech (against Internet censorship in countries such as China, Iraq, and increasingly the United States)
* whistleblowing
* software or speech that violates laws such as the DMCA
* copyright infringement
* circumventing data protection laws
* online gambling
* pornography


There is an understood rule amongst most of those who establish or support data havens that they should not be used to facilitate spam, terrorism, or [child pornography](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-child-pornography).

HavenCo (centralized) and Freenet (decentralized) are two modern-day data havens, with the former utilizing the [Principality of Sealand](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-sealand) six miles off the coast of Britain. 

This use of the term was coined by [Bruce Sterling](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-bruce-sterling) in his 1989 novel *Islands in the Net* (infamous for connecting Tauregs and SCOP), and further expanded upon by [Neal Stephenson](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-neal-stephenson) in *[Cryptonomicon](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-cryptonomicon)*.
