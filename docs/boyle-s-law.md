Boyle's law states that if the temperature remains constant, the volume of a mass of gas is inversely proportional to the pressure. This can also be stated as: PV = nRT. The practical implications of this law are important when engaging in activities such as scuba diving or pumping up a bicycle tire.

[Boyle's law is actually PV = k, where k is a constant; this is sometimes written in the form P1V1 = P2V2, where "1" and "2" represent initial and final states of a gas. So, for example, if you suddenly double the volume of a gas, its pressure will fall to half the original pressure. 

The equation PV = nRT is more commonly called the ideal gas law (or universal gas law).]

In this formula:
P is pressure
V is volume 
n is the number of moles of gas
R is the ideal gas constant
T is temperature

The value of R depends on the units used elsewhere. For SI units, R = 8.314 joules/kelvin/mole; another common value is 0.0821 liters-atmospheres/mole-kelvin. [Pressure x volume is equivalent to energy, which is why one form can have liters times atmospheres while another uses joules.]
