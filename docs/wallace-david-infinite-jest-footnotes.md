# Wallace:David:Infinite Jest:Footnotes

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

wallace-l 29 April 1996:

Somebody wrote in last week that they hoped the footnotes did not represent
Wallace simply "letting himself go." Our friend Steely from (and on) the
Pynchon List also noted last week that the Village Voice Literary Supplement
contained a review penned by DFW that contained more of his "annoying" or
"distracting" (something like that) footnotes.

I thought I'd note that Wallace has been sort of testing out his use of
footnotes in the manner they're used in The Jest for a while now. He co-wrote
(with his college buddy, Mark Costello) a non-fiction book (kind of an extended
essay) on rap, called "Signifying Rappers, about 5-6 years ago. This book
contained very Jest-like footnotes. And, of course, his Harper's article from
earlier this year about his experience on a Caribbean cruise was (hilariously)
footnoted.

I guess what I'm suggesting is that the footnotes are not Jest-specific (though
they might well be used in The Jest in some particular way or with a particular
strategy). My impression is that Wallace is using footnotes to achieve a few
different ends. First, they allow him to "go on" about something in greater
detail without disrupting the flow of the "main text" itself. I realize that
many would say that this is precisely what interrupts the text, but this seems
to be a way of making some of his flights of fancy kinda "optional" for the
reader -- and it certainly makes the order in which you get to these byways
optional. Since the footnotes often cross-reference you to other notes or to
other points of intersection with the main text, they also serve to subvert the
pure linear narrative of the story, arguably generating a kind of low-tech
hypertext. Also, since footnotes are typically associated with dense academic
writing (law review articles, for example), his use of them to make fun and tell
jokes seems like a new way of mocking the distinction between "high" and "low"
writing. His all-time greatest footnote has got to be one from the Cruise
Article where he tells us that a guy on the boat has his own skeet-shooting
set-up in his back yard. You follow the note to the bottom of the page only to
encounter "!".

I know that many have moaned about the notes in The Jest, but for me they're
part of the great play of the book -- a pretty terrific jungle gym for this 35
year-old.

The same day:

I'm the one who wrote about the footnotes (well, endnotes, really) last 
week - I definitely don't find them distracting or unenjoyable, although 
having to constantly flip to the back of the book was annoying, but only 
an unfortunate side-effect of book technology (at least until I leveraged 
existing bookmark technology to mark my current place in both the text 
and the endnotes :-). I, as you can see, prefer parenthetical asides to 
any amount of foot- or endnoting.

I also agree that whether a character of Wallace himself is supposed to 
be the author of the footnotes, it is obvious that Wallace was enjoying 
himself in writing them. After all, towards the end of the book, there 
is at least one break between two sections in the text with a single 
endnote on an otherwise blank line referencing an entire multi-page chunk 
of text which could just as easily have been put in the text itself...

No matter who 'authored' the endnotes, though, their informal style still 
raises the point that Dan Schmidt and I were debating immediately after 
finishing the book - whether \_Jest\_ is as carefully constructed as a 
\_Gravity's Rainbow\_ or a \_Ulysses\_ or whether Wallace just sort of let it 
happen, which might account for some of the inconsistencies and errors 
which have been spotted. In either case, *especially* the latter, 
Wallace is a mad literary genius, but I think I'm more in the camp of mad 
literary geniuses who plan carefully than mad literary slacker geniuses.

Subject: wallace-l: more on footnotes 


I think the endnotes (also called errata if I recall correctcly) were a 
fascinating and important part of the book. Three thoughts on them:

1) I, too, was forced to employ the high-tech strategy of multiple bookmarks. I 
even had a third for a while, marking the page where the order of the years is 
finally explained (224 if I recall correctly).

2) Sven Birkerts made what I thought was a great point in his Atlantic review. 
He suggested that the book models distributed systems like the Internet by 
scattering important information throughout the novel. A lot of REALLY key 
points get buried in otherwise digressive endnotes, and assembling them is part 
part of the work of the novel, what Wallace keeps talking about in his endless 
interviews.

3) Wallace is also parodying academics, I think, much like Swift was doing in 
his satires (e.g., Battle of the Books).
