 downtown 
One of the main musical and plot memes in the [Winona Ryder](/winona-ryder)'s movie [Girl, interrupted](/girl-interrupted) *"awfully butchered by [Carl Holywood](/carl-holywood), start watching the DVD from deleted scenes with and without directors commentary, watch the titles"*, based on a [Susanne Kaysen](/susanne-kaysen)'s novel describing her "healing" at psychiatric ward after she suffers from [borderline personality disorder](/borderline-personality-disorder) which mainly manifest itself by her (played by [Winona Ryder](/winona-ryder)) experiencing breaches in so called reality she is living and "too much sexual activity", curiously, [dowtown](/dowtown) also. [Downtown](/downtown) is used as a theme song and a plot module. Curiously similar to the [Leased Territories](/leased-territories) from [The Diamond Age](/the-diamond-age), where [Little Nell](/little-nell) starts her adventures.

[Susanna Kaysen](/susanna-kaysen)'s novel is a biographical one (like [Charlotte Bronson](/charlotte-bronson)'s [Jane Eyre](/jane-eyre)), she and her character, Susanna, is a writer. By reading a book and then watching the movie (in mentioned order) you can guess that Susanna has a [ESP](/esp) powers. Girls (inmates of the asylum she is kept in) are accusing her of plotting them, because, as you see, while in the asylum, she is writing the book itself. She is considered "healed" when the book is "right", which of course means what the doctors assume as right way. The girls (characters) are accusing her of betraying them by changing the reality so she can be considered "healthy" and not "hurting everyone around" (the words pronounced by a [Doctor](/doctor) character talking with her for 10 minutes and committing to the asylum at the beginning of the movie.

1. Curious fact, we observe, that he is a writer too!.
2. Curious fact, The deleted scenes suggest that [Susanna Kaysen](/susanna-kaysen)'s character/person is trapped in a quasi time loop, she will return from [downtown](/downtown) to asylum until the [Doctors](/doctor) decide she can. [Turing Test](/turing-test)?
3. Curious fact, the [Winona Ryder](/winona-ryder)'s character says at the beginning of the story "have you ever stolen anything even if you had the money"? and she **does** so in the reality observed by readers of [Quicksilver](/quicksilver) novel. Curiouser and curiouser says [Alice](/alice)....
