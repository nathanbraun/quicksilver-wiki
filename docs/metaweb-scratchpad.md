# Metaweb:Scratchpad

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.



This page is the **scratchpad**. It is a page anyone may edit to try out their ideas. This is a good place to experiment with the Metaweb's text markup language. Click the "Edit this page" link to edit it. 

See [how to edit a page](/metaweb-how-to-edit-a-page) for a description of how to edit and format text. Here's a summary.

## New section 1



*italic* and **bold**.  

In reverse, **italic** and *bold*.  

*Con**cen**tric*  

*Over**lap*****ping**  

*HTML* - **style**  

Chromatic  

Rainbow  

*x*2 - *x* - 1  




Line breaks in the source
don't affect the layout, but

an empty line makes a brand new paragraph, like TeX. You can also force a line break  
without making a new paragraph.

#### New subsubsection (looks the same as a subsection)



* Lists are easy to do with stars:
	+ more stars means deeper levels


1. Numbered lists too,
	1. Going in
		1. and in
	2. and back out



```
 Preformatted text starts with a space.

*Notes*
1. /kh/ here means IPA /x/, or the guttural sound in Scots *loch*.
2. *Ayin* is silent for many speakers, or pharyngeal like Arabic *ain* for those with more contact with Arabic.

The hard sounds /b k p/ are indicated by the dot called *dagesh* inside them, and the soft sounds /v kh f/ lack *dagesh*. Soft sounding letters are 'vet,' 'khaf' and 'fe' respectfully. The two sounds given for *shin* and "sin" are not predictable in the same way. The /sh/ value is much more common. They are distinguished in vowelled texts by the position of a dot above them. The /s/ sound is the same as that of the letter *samech*. 

When teaching younger children; The lesson is that if the dot is on the left it's a "sin" which resolves most questions.

On charts of the Hebrew aleph-bet there are three positions of the letter "tav" as well.

I could see the sounds as a basis for a quasi-Phonecian seapeople alphabet mixed in with a proto-Finnish glyph writing peoples seeking tin in the good islands already populated by Basque Gaels and Welsh speaking Picts that become known as:
