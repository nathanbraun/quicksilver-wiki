# Stephenson:Neal:The System of the World:Typos

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

This page contains a list of typos and apparent typos in the first edition. If you see a typo not listed here, please add them. If any already here are in error, please correct the entry and move it to the appropriate section. Note that this is a constructive way to correct future editions of the book. 

Page numbers are based on the First Edition, First Printing in the US - the Hardcover.

* page xiii, top: "Massachusetts Bay Colony of Technologickal Arts" [should be M.B.C. *Institute* of T.A.]
* page 28, 1/3 down: "situate between" [situated]
* page 81, 1/4 down: "manufactures of" [I think should be manufactur^er^s]
* page 82, 1/2 down: "nibbling on a pasty" [pastry?] {"pasties" is used again later so I guess it is meant to be spelled thusly} {"pasty" - with the 'a' pronounced as in "past" rather than "paste" - is a traditional Cornish food product, popular all over Britain. US approx equiv "pattie"?}
* page 105, 3/4 down: "... before you can say, 'avast, that is expensive!"' [incorrect quote order, causing incorrect apostrophe]
* page 118, 1/4 down: "...raising his cudgel to dash Daniel's brain's out:..." [brain's should not have an apostrophe; should be "brains."]
* page 135, "interior" is used where I presume "exterior" is meant: "What with so many distractions, they were inside the new house before Daniel had really had the time to examine its interior."
* page 187, 1/4 down: "-so say nothing of the risk incurred-"
* page 224, 1/2 down: Daniel and Barnes are speaking in alternate paragraphs, then there is apparently a paragraph break between two sentences by Daniel: "...water in the oceans. [break] But is to..." (No indication of speaker is given for several turns, other than contextual clues, but if each break is considered a change, it does not come out correctly.)
* page 439, 3/4 down: "... description of Lother's little-known "stepbrother"..."
* page 398, 1/2 down: Eliza's talking about a castle "Ubersetzenseehafenstadtbergwald", which seems to be a name she made up. But i think the name should have been different, because it means something like "translate-sea-harbour-city-mountain-forest" (and anyway - this name is just ridiculous!).

I don't think that's an error; there's a guy with a similar name in Cryptonomicon: *"He was born Graf Heinrich Karl Wilhelm Otto Friedrich von Übersetzenseehafenstadt, but changed his name to Nigel St. John Gloamthorpby, a.k.a. Lord Woadmire, in 1914."*—[Andux](/user-andux)
See discussion page.
Uebersetzen doesn't only mean 'to translate', it also means 'to ferry across' (a river or a lake) which makes more sense here. But yes, the name is ridiculous :-)
* page 454 2nd last para: Newton says: "...went off to nurse her nuncle" is followed by 2nd para on next page: Daniel says "...she has done well by her uncle". Nuncle is acceptable english (see Shakespeare) but normally serves as a contraction of MINE uncle or AN uncle.
* page 480: "Mr. Kikin was amused by the ... faces of Orney and Kikin" Should be "Orney and Threader"
* page 497, 3/4 down: "as it is styl'd by my somonolent Colleague" [I think "somnolent" is meant, but this could be a modification made at Stephenson's phant'sy]
* page 511, 1/2 down: "the Edict of Nantes in 1685" should be either "the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685" or "the Edict of Fontainebleau". A Huguenot couln't possibly make the mistake and Stephenson got it correct in other parts of the book.
* page 515, 2/3 down: "...fear of a certain suttler..." [elsewhere sutler]
* page 542, 1/2 down: "exhiliration" [exhilaration]
* page 543, 3/4 down: "and may phant'sy that I have kllled as many as Tamerlane,"
* page 586, 3/4 down: " "I wonder about that," said. "
* page 622: refers to "Carox" initially, then "Corax" for the rest of the page ([Corax](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-corax) appears to be the correct spelling)
* page 708, near top: Bank of England is called Bank of Hanover [the only occurrence, after having just been referred to as the B. of E.; and later always referred to as the B. of E. If it were someone speaking, it might be a jest on their part, but rather than a quote, it is a phrase summing up Daniel's explanation to Marlborough.]
