**My baby girl**
I am a fan of Neal Stephenson, Neil Gaiman, several other Neils, Jim Dodge, Robert Heinlein, Math, Water Polo, Drums, Aaron Sorkin, Joss Whedon, The Action Request System, some other geeky stuff, and [my family](/http-www-konas-com).

I finished [The System of the World](/stephenson-neal-the-system-of-the-world) on December 22nd, and now I am going through Stephenson withdrawls. I am making sideways glances at my copy of *The Big U* even though I have been cautioned against it by many, including Stephenson himself. Perhaps it is time to explore new authors. I have heard good things about [China Mieville](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-china-mieville)....
