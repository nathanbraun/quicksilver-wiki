*[Randy Waterhouse](/randy-waterhouse) encounters the everpresent AK47 in the [PIs](/stephenson-neal-cryptonomicon-30-the-real-philippines-randy-pays-no-attention-to-it-alan-sinder) but the below scene is important as we're talking about California ...

     ...In the lot of the 24 Jam, Mike or Mark has joined three other elvishlooking sorts in black cowboy hats and bandannas, whom Randy can identify based on the length and color of their ponytails and beards. There's Stu, a Berkeley grad student who is somehow mixed up in Avi's HEAP project, and Phil, who invented a major programming language a couple of years ago and goes helicopter-skiing in his spare time, and Craig, who knows everything there is to know about encrypted credit-card transactions on the Net and is a devotee of traditional Nipponese archery. Some of these guys are wearing long coats and some aren't. There is a lot of Secret Admirers iconography: t-shirts bearing the number 56, which is a code for Yamamoto, or just pictures of Yamamoto himself, or big fat question marks. They are having an energetic and very happy conversation--though it looks a bit forced--because, to a man, they are carrying long weapons out in plain sight. One of them has a hunting rifle, and each of the others is slinging a rudimentary-looking gun with a banana clip sticking out of the side. Randy thinks, but is not sure, that these are HEAP guns.
     This scene, not surprisingly, has caught the attention of the police, who have surrounded these four with squad cars, and who are standing at the ready with rifles and shotguns. It is an oddity of the law in many jurisdictions that, while carrying (say) a concealed one-shot .22 derringer requires a license, openly carrying (e.g.) a big game rifle is perfectly legal. Concealed weapons are outlawed or at least heavily regulated, and unconcealed ones are not. So a lot of Secret Admirers--who tend to be gun nuts--have taken to going around conspicuously armed as a way of pointing out the absurdity of those rules. Their point is this: who gives a shit about concealed weapons anyway, since they are only useful for defending oneself against assaults by petty criminals, which almost never happens? The real reason the Constitution provides for the right to bear arms is defending oneself against oppressive governments, and when it comes to that, your handgun is close to useless. So (according to these guys) if you are going to assert your right to keep and bear arms you should do it openly, by packing something really big. ...
I also like this footnote:
     It goes without saying that the Finns have to have their own sui generis brand of automatic weapon.*

**AK-47 Assault Rifle**
  
**Length:**    34.6 in    **Weight:**    9.3 lbs

**Capacity:**    30 rounds
  
**Rate of Fire:**    640 rpm    **Effective Range:**    300 m  
[larger version](/larger-version)
The **AK-47** (for **Avtomat Kalashnikova model 1947 goda**, *Russian: автомат Калашникова образца 1947 года*) is an [assault rifle](/) designed in [1947](/) by [Mikhail Kalashnikov](/), produced by [Russian](/) arms manufacturer [IZH](/), and used in many [Eastern bloc](/) nations during the [Cold War](/). Compared to the [rifles](/) used in [World War II](/), the AK-47 was lighter and more compact, with a shorter range, a smaller [7.62 x 39 mm](/) cartridge, and was capable of [fully-automatic](/) fire. This was possible due to the lower recoil of the cartridge allowing practical [fully-automatic](/) fire, thus making it one of the first assault rifles.

It also has a legendary reputation for ruggedness, reliability, and ease of field maintenance. Inexpensive to manufacture, the AK-47 is the most widespread of all small arms, with 50-80 million weapons having been produced. Despite its official depreciation by the Russian military, the weapon and its derivatives are still widely manufactured and used, especially throughout the [Third World](/).

### Development


In World War II, most soldiers used longer rifles such as the American [M1 Garand](/); these weapons were good at placing single shots of powerful rounds at long distances, but were slow and clunky close in. [U.S.](/) [Thompson Sub-machine gun](/) were common in urban combat; while lighter and faster to fire than a rifle, the [pistol](/) rounds they fired were often too weak to be effective. (Soviet research found that they were not even consistent in penetrating heavy winter clothing!) Assault rifles such as the AK-47 represent a practical compromise between the two types of weapon. In contrast, Western powers replaced WW2-era rifles with [battle rifles](/) such as the [M14](/) and the [FN FAL](/).

The AK-47 was not the first assault rifle but was preceded by earlier [Italian](/), Russian, and [German](/) [Sturmgewehr 44](/) assault rifle designs. Mikhail Kalashnikov furiously denies it being *based* on the German or Italian models. 

Tank sergeant [Mikhail Timofeyevich Kalashnikov](/) began imagining his weapon while still in the hospital, after being wounded in the battle of [Bryansk](/). He had been informed that a new weapon was required for the 7.62 × 39 cartridge developed by Elisarov and Semin in [1943](/). Sudayev's [PPS43](/) submachinegun was preferred to Kalashnikov's first attempt, but Kalashnikov redesigned the rifle after examining a German [STG 44](/) in [1946](/). 

There were many difficulties during the first phase of production, as at first the Soviets were not able to use stamped sheet metal construction (as the Germans had). Instead, they preferred machining the components, a slower and costlier process. Even though it was famous as the "AK 47" (where AK stands for *Avtomat Kalashnikova,* or Kalashnikov's Machine gun), the Soviets were not able to distribute it to soldiers until [1956](/). The first transfer-stamped sheet metal version appeared in [1959](/) and is named the AKM. 

In [1974](/) the Soviet military began replacing the AK-47 with the AK-74, which fires the smaller, lighter [5.45 x 39 mm M74](/) round, enabling troops to carry more ammunition and easing strain on supply systems.

#### Notable features


The AK-47 is inexpensive to manufacture and very simple to clean and repair in the field. Its ruggedness and reliability are legendary, and it can fire even after being submerged in water (if the water is poured out first), or when it is covered in dirt. Some sources claim that the ejector pin is prone to breakage (depending on the exact alloy and heat treatment, it may or may not be likely with a particular rifle – Romanian AKs are prone to it, Russian and Bulgarian AKs aren't).

Some AK rifles are considerably more [accurate](/) than others. The first AK-47s (not the AKM) and the Bulgarian AK types, with their heavy milled receivers, as well as Yugoslav and late [AK-74](/) rifles from Russia, with their heavy 1.6 mm stamped receivers, are usually said to be capable of accuracy of two [MOA](/). Most AK type rifles, with thin 1.0 mm stamped receivers, are less stable as the bullet goes through the barrel and there is consequently greater random [vibration](/) and oscillation before the bullet leaves the muzzle, and are typically only capable of approximately six MOA accuracy. Most Western military rifles are capable of 2 MOA or better.

Classic AK-series have a cyclic rate of 600 rounds per minute. Newer versions have delayed automatic [sears](/) that cycle at 300 round/min.

AK-type rifles do not lock the bolt back when they are empty, unlike most Western assault rifles.

The standard flip-up iron sight is calibrated with each numeral indicating in hundreds of meters. It is released by squeezing the two buttons on the back end. The standard calibration of the flipped-down sight is 50 meters, the normal minimal distance for aimed fire. Distances below this range are usually aimed instinctively. For night fighting, some Russian models have a flip-up luminous dot, also calibrated to 50 m. The open sights are one of the most heavily-criticized features of the rifle, being both farther from the eye than many common rifle sights, and less accurate than peep-sights, such as those found on the [M16](/) rifles. Sights, of course, are a matter of personal taste, but most people do find the aperture-type sights on Western military rifles like the [M16](/), [M14](/), or [FAL](/) to be both faster and easier to use, as well as being more accurate.

The magazine release is in front of the trigger guard. The [trigger guard](/) is very large, to permit the use of gloved fingers.

A sling is provided for accurate aimed fire. It should wrap around the forearm supporting the barrel.

Models for [paratroopers](/), [cavalry](/), and [mechanized troops](/) have [folding stocks](/). Most fold sideways, but a few fold downward and forward over the pistol grip like the folding stock on the old German MP40 submachinegun.

[Bullpup](/) variants exist, in which a shoulder pad is bolted onto the back of the receiver, and the trigger is moved in front of the magazine. These have a shorter overall length because they have no stock, yet they still have full-length barrels. Small numbers of semi-auto bullpup rifles of the AK type were imported into the US from [Finland](/) and [China](/) in the early [1990s](/), where they now command healthy four-figure sums among collectors of rare and unusual military firearms.

Some models, mainly [Chinese](/), include an integral folding bayonet. Almost all others have a removable bayonet; some of these can attach to their scabbards to form a scissors-style barbed-wire cutter (a feature later integrated into the M9 [bayonet](/) used with the M16 rifle).

Some models, mainly [Yugoslav](/) and [Polish](/), include a gas valve on the forward gas port (above the barrel) to permit [firing grenades](/). Sometimes the valve is controlled by flipping a special "grenade sight" up into position.

The [bore](/) and [chamber](/), as well as the gas piston and the interior of the [gas cylinder](/), are almost always [chromium](/)-plated, to resist corrosion and improve wear resistance, but cleaning after every firing is strongly recommended. Much military ammunition uses corrosive [primers](/), particularly ammunition of Soviet, Chinese, or Eastern European origin, the residue from which can eventually corrode steel if the weapon is fired and left dirty.

### Ballistics


The standard AK-47 or AKM fires a [7.62 × 39 mm](/) [round](/) with a muzzle velocity of 710 m/s. Muzzle energy is 1,990 [joules](/). Cartridge case length is 38.6 mm, weight is 18.21 g. Projectile weight is normally 8 g, though some Russian ammunition made for export to the US uses a soft-nose hunting type bullet of 10 g mass.

The AK-47 and AKM, with the 7.62 x 39 mm cartridge, had an effective range of around 300 meters and usually had the sights zeroed at 200 meters. The rate of fire is between 300 and 600 rounds per minute. Later models have modifications to the trigger assembly and bolt to fire more slowly. This helps make the weapon more controllable and waste less ammunition. This can help reduce logistic requirements. The rate-reducing devices may also be intended to reduce the wear and tear on moving parts.

### Operation

[Larger image](/larger-image)
To fire, insert a loaded [magazine](/), move the right selector lever on the right to the bottom position, and pull back and release the cocking lever on the right top. Aim and pull the trigger.

The selector lever is a large lever on the right side, easy to manipulate even with mittens under arctic conditions. The selector lever blocks the [bolt](/) and cocking handle when it is in the "safe" position, so the rifle can only be loaded with the [safety](/) off. Kalashnikov made this design decision because when the safety lever is in the upward position, it covers the slot in the side of the receiver behind the cocking handle, preventing sand and dirt from entering the mechanism.

The selector lever makes a loud and very distinctive sound when it is moved from one position to another.

The highest position of the selector lever is safe. Safe prevents trigger movement and cocking, and the selector lever covers the slot in the receiver behind the cocking handle in order to keep out sand and dust. In many models, this position is unmarked. International weapons may place a "0" in this position.

The bottom position is [single-shot](/). On Russian weapons this is marked "ОД" in [Cyrillic](/), from ОДин (one). International weapons may have a "1" or a single dot. 

The middle position is [full automatic](/). On Russian weapons this is marked with "АВ" in Cyrillic, from АВтомат (automatic). International weapons have an infinity-sign (∞) or multiple dots in this position.

Some AK-type rifles have a fourth selector setting, usually between full-auto and semi-auto, normally three or four rounds per burst. On Bulgarian rifles built with this feature, this selector position is usually marked with the numeral 3 or 4. On most variants, under the barrel is a steel cleaning rod. It bends slightly for removal. In standard AKs, cleaning patches and a metal bottle of oil and solvent are in compartments in the shoulder-pad of the stock.

To field strip, release the magazine catch, remove the magazine, and cock the rifle, holding the left hand ready over the receiver to catch any ejected cartridge. Release the catch on the right side of the rear sight. Push the piston assembly cover forward, detaching it from the rear receiver. Lift it and then pull it backwards. Remove the piston assembly and bolt. Clean as needed, with special attention to the barrel, gas cylinder and gas piston. Oil slightly and reassemble. Before inserting the magazine, press the trigger to release the spring tension.

### Influence


The AK-47 and its derivatives are favoured by some non-[Western](/) powers because of their ease of use, robustness, and simplicity to manufacture, and also because during the Cold War the [Russians](/) were giving [AKM](/) rifles away in great numbers to their allies all over the [Third World](/). Copies were made by many factories in other countries including [USA](/), [Finland](/) (though the [Finnish](/) rifles are sufficiently different that many experts consider them AK-inspired but not pure AK), [Hungary](/), [China](/), [Poland](/), [Romania](/), [Bulgaria](/), [Egypt](/) and [Pakistan](/), where they remain in production today. Derivative designs were made in [USA](/), [East Germany](/), Finland, Hungary, [Israel](/), [North Korea](/), Poland, and [Yugoslavia](/). Estimates of total number of units produced vary from 55 million to 100 million.

Copies, licensed and otherwise, manufactured in other countries had different nomenclature, and tended to differ from the original in small ways - Bulgarian AK-47 type rifles are made with the old milled receiver rather than stampings, Chinese 'Type 1956' rifles have the gas tube attached to the barrel in a slightly different arrangement and a permanently attached folding cruciform spike [bayonet](/) under the muzzle, the East German [MPiK-47](/) rifles had buttstocks and handguards of pebble-finished black plastic instead of wood, etc. Copies may or may not have the slant-cut [muzzle brake](/) of the AKM. Further, end users may have modified their rifles. For instance, AKMs and close copies thereof made in Russia and various Warsaw Pact countries and given to the government of [India](/) as military aid during the Cold War have since [1995](/) mostly been fitted with flash suppressors that are copies of the one on the [M16A2](/) rifle and bayonet lugs compatible with US-issue bayonets for the M16 rifle.

Copies of the AK-47 are also manufactured in [Dara Adamkhel](/) in tribal areas of [Pakistan](/). It became so popular in Pakistan that it has become a social symbol for the [Pathan](/) tribesmen who live there. Owning an AK-47 (or a copy made by a local [gunsmith](/)) is considered to be proof of manhood. *Better than an endangered rhino horn knife sheath one must suppose.*

The AK-47 is included in [Mozambique](/) [coat of arms](/) (formerly also in [Burkina Faso](/) coat of arms), as a symbol of the Soviet-backed [Marxist](/) government's support for anti-Western governments like the [Qaddafi](/) regime in [Libya](/) and the [Idi Amin](/) regime in [Uganda](/), as well as its willingness to supply Soviet-made weapons to anti-Western terrorist groups such as [Robert Mugabe](/)'s "Zimbabwe People's Liberation Army" in [Rhodesia](/) and the "Southwest African People's Organization" in [Angola](/), during the Cold War. *[Kalash](/)*, a derivative from "Kalashnikov" is used as a name for boys in some African countries.

### Versions


Standard Kalashnikovs include:
* AK-47 1948–51, 7.62 × 39 mm. The very earliest models had a stamped sheet metal receiver. Now rare.
* AK-47 1952, 7.62 × 39 mm: has a milled receiver and wooden buttstock and hand-guard. Barrel and chamber are chrome-plated to resist corrosion. Rifle weight 4.2 kg.
* AKS-47 × Featured an upward-folding metal stock as opposed to the fixed wood stock of the AK-47.
* AKM 7.62 × 39 mm: a revised, lower-cost version of the AK-47; receiver is made from several pieces of stamped sheet-metal riveted together and a revized muzzle flash suppressor. Rifle weight 3.61 kg.
* AKS-74 5.45 × 39 mm ([AK-74](/)); note the new, much smaller ammunition.
* [AK-74M](/) 5.45 × 39 mm folding stock (for motorised infantry)
* [AKS-74U](/) 5.45 × 39 mm, tanker's self-defense weapon, folding stock, short barrel, altered sight and gas mechanism, odd-looking flash suppressor device on the muzzle. Nicknamed the "Krinkov" after its designer. Very popular with Spetznaz (Russian Special Forces) troops as well as Russian law enforcement in Russia's large cities.


The AKM design is still in production in Russia, now in a modernized form utilising lightweight plastics instead of some wood and metal components:
* [AK-101](/) 5.56 × 45 mm round ([NATO](/) round)
* [AK-102](/) short stock 101
* [AK-103](/) 7.62 × 39 mm round
* [AK-104](/) short stock 103
* [AK-105](/) 5.45 × 39 mm round (short stock)


Derivative designs included these: 
* [SVD](/) [Dragunov](/) 7.62 × 54 mm 10 shot [sniper](/) rifle. This is semiautomatic, with a skeletal laminated "outline" stock. The standard optical sight is the PSO-1. Uses a unique, short-stroke piston system because a standard piston for the larger cartridge was so heavy that it upset the point of aim. The piston moves a bolt-carrier. Has a very distinctive flash suppressor device on the muzzle resembling that mounted on the PKM general purpose machine gun. Developed in [1958](/) by Yevgeniy Feodorovich Dragunov, a gunsmith at the Izhevsk Machine Factory, where he originally designed sporting rifles. Not as accurate as Western military issue sniper rifles but very rugged and reliable. Popular with the troops, it is nicknamed the "veslo," which means "oar."
* [MedVed Sporting Rifle](/), 9 × 54 mm. Very similar to the SVD.
* [RPK 74](/) [squad automatic weapon](/), identical to an AK-74 but featuring a thicker, longer barrel and fixed bipod,
* [OC-14](/) Groza, a bullpup rifle nearly identical to an AK-74 in function that also shares many internal parts,
* [Saiga](/) 12K, a semi-automatic [shotgun](/),
* [AKR](/) (Russians evolution),
* [Type 56](/) ([China](/)),
* [Yugoslavia](/): M64, M64A, M70, M70A, M79B, M79A1B, M77, M82, The M77B1 takes a [NATO](/) 7.62 × 51 mm rifle round, and is Yugoslavia's [squad automatic weapon](/).
* [Finland](/): Assault rifle model [Rk 62](/) has been offered in 13 variants, with 7.62 × 39 mm, 5.56 × 45, and 7.62 × 51 [Cartridge (weaponry)|cartridges](/) and metal, folding and plastic stocks, [Valmet](/) M60, M62, M76, M82. The M82 is a [bullpup](/) design, with the action and magazine moved into the stock, and the trigger far forward on the barrel.
* [Galil](/) ([Israel](/)), argued by some to be AK-inspired but not a pure AK, it has aperture sights and uses a proprietary 35-round magazine for the 5.56 x 45 mm NATO cartridge. Most have an extremely rugged (and rather heavy) steel buttstock that folds to the side. Regarded as a good design but poor quality control when most were manufactured in the 1970s has given the Galil a poor reputation among Israeli troops, who are today mostly issued M16A1 rifles instead. A licensed copy of the Galil is made in South Africa, called the R4.
* [PGM-DGM-60](/) ([Poland](/)), which can shoot grenades; there are other AK variants made in Poland, and the Polish government is considering going to a 5.56 x 45 mm AK variant called the "Beryl" after joining NATO. The Beryl has a distinctive looking perforated stamped steel handguard and a folding buttstock resembling that of the old German MP40 submachinegun.
* [East Germany](/):MPiK, cal.22LR KKMPi69, STG940 "Wieger"
* FPK, AKM-R, ([Romania](/)), WASR-10 a low quality semi-auto civilian version that only accepts smaller magazines, exported to the US. The WASR-10 has a reputation for being poorly made, and is prone to parts breakage, particularly the ejector. ROMAK-3 Copy of RPK Squad automatic weapon converted into sniper rifle.
* [Hungary](/): [AMD-63](/), [AMD-65](/), [AMP-69](/)
* [North Korea](/) [Type 58](/) and [68](/). The 68 has a distinctive perforated stock-strut.
* The [South African](/) [R4](/) and [R5](/) rifles, licensed copies of the Galil from Israel.


It is a common misconception that the Czech assault-rifle [Sa vz.58](/) is an AK-47 derivative, but despite its external resemblance it is a completely original design.

### AK-74


[![AK74 assault rifle](/web/20060725165534im_/http://www.metaweb.com/wiki/upload/7/79/MW-AK74a.jpg)](ak74-assault-rifle)  
**AK74 Assault Rifle**  
**Length:**    37.0 in    **Weight:**    8.7 lbs  
**Caliber:**    5.45 x 39 mm    **Capacity:**    30 rounds  
**Rate of Fire:**    600 rpm    **Effective Range:**    500 m  
[larger version](/larger-version)

The **AK-74** [assault rifle](/) is the modernized version of the [AK-47](/ak-47) developed in 1974, chambered in a smaller [cartridge](/) ([5.45 x 39 mm](/) vs. [7.62 x 39 mm](/)). The weapon began [mass-production](/) in [1976](/). The 5.45 mm bullet has an air pocket inside that allows it to tumble when striking a soft target such as a human, making increasing wounding effects. The [Afghans](/) who fought the [Soviet Union](/) often referred to the 5.45 mm as "the poison bullet" because of its capacity to maim. 

The weapon is another [Mikhail Kalashnikov](/) design, with a system of operation described as a long-stroke gas system, with a rotating bolt locking mechanism. The [receiver](/) is made of stamped sheet metal, and is extremely durable. The AK-74 has other slight differences from the AKM, such as having a rather large and distinctive-looking cylindrical muzzle brake at the muzzle, and most have been manufactured with black plastic stocks rather than laminated wood. Most AK-74s that have black plastic stocks have a hinge in the buttstock just behind the receiver so that the rifle can be folded for storage. Many AK-74s have a front sight base that is more narrow, as viewed from the side, than the front sight base of the AKM. The current version, the AK-74M, has a mounting rail on the left side of the receiver for mounting a telescopic sight or a night sight and all-black plastic furniture. It was introduced in [1991](/) and is currently the standard assault rifle of the Russian military. 

The various [Warsaw Pact](/) countries were mostly slowly converting to the new 5.45 x 39 mm cartridge when the Soviet Union ceased to exist, making various derivative 5.45 x 39 mm calibre rifles with varying degrees of slight difference from the Russian AK-74. The Kalashnikov series of weapons are world-renowned for their reliability. 

It is claimed that, as a result of combat experience in Afghanistan and Chechnya, the Russian army wants to go back to the old 7.62 x 39 mm cartridge and use a rifle designated [AK-103](/). This is basically a 1990s-production AK-74, with the muzzle brake, folding plastic stock, and optics mounting rail of the AK-74, but in the old 7.62 x 39 mm caliber.

The weapon fires a [5.45 × 39 mm](/) [round](/) with a muzzle velocity of 900 m/s. Muzzle energy is 1,385 [joules](/), giving an effective range of around 400m. (The sights are zeroed for 300m.) The cartridge weight is 10.75 g. Projectile weight is 3.42 g. The new cartridge was designed to give greater effective range (because of the high velocity) and greater controllability in full-auto fire (due to the reduced recoil).

### Operation


To fire, insert a loaded magazine, move the right selector lever on the right to the bottom position, and pull back and release the cocking lever on the right top. Aim and pull trigger.

### [Dangerfinder V.4: AK-47 (Avtomat Kalishnikova Obrazets 1947g)](/http-www-comebackalive-com-df-guns-bang-htm)


If there is one visual symbol or prop that symbolizes the Soviet/revolutionary influence, it is the unmistakable profile of the AK-47. Once it was the hammer and sickle; now it is the banana-shaped clip and pointed barrel of the world's most dangerous rifle. 

These weapons are cheap (between $50 and $350), available around the world, rock-hard reliable, and in use from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. It is estimated that there are about 30 to 50 million copies of the rugged rifle in existence. They can pour out 600 rounds a minute and are designed to be manufactured and repaired in primitive conditions. They use a chromed barrel and the only major defect is the loud click when you change firing rate. (complete at [link](/http-www-comebackalive-com-df-guns-bang-htm))
