# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:183:Meeting of the Society (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

These approximately three pages are a mixture of fictional material (basically anything to do with
[Waterhouse](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-daniel-waterhouse), [Gunfleet](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-thomas-more-anglesey), or  [Louis Upnor](/louis-anglesey-earl-of-upnor)) with fragments culled from the records of real [Royal Society](/royal-society) meetings of this era.
