# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:20:A harder question (Jeremy Bornstein)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

It seems as if this cryptic comment by [Enoch Root](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-enoch-root) must be a clue as to his true nature. This comment makes it sound like he's a time traveller to me, although other passages just seem to indicate that he has just lived an extraordinarily long time. (Of course, both are possible.)
