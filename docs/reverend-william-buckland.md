From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

## Reverend Dr. William Buckland (1784-1856)


President of the Geological Society in England and the Dean of Westminster

Buckland discovered and named the first dinosaur, Megalosaurus which, poetically at least, connects with Bobby's giant [lizard](/megalania-prisca).

*There are many versions of this (apocryphal ?) story.*  
Apparently the Rev and his son Francis were fond of eating what others considered unpalatable, like, oh, human hearts for example. Lord Harcourt happened to have [Louis XIV](/louis-xiv)'s heart for sale and, since he was feeling a bit peckish at the time, Buckland bought it off him and ate it up. His abominable dining habits seem reminiscent of [someone](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-d-arcachon) in Quicksilver.
