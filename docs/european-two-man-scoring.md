#### Authored Entry


Two man scoring was first made known to me by [Jack A. Sobon](/jack-a-sobon-timberbee). In a single line on the back of a postcard he made note of a curious style where, in stark contrast to the style we had been practicing -- one which had broad historical roots in our area ([Single\_Man\_Scoring](/single-man-scoring)), that of the North Eastern United States -- this method involved Two men doing the work of one, And, what's more, rather than stand atop the log and strike the vertical face below one's feet, as any Sane, and Normal, soul would do, These folks stood upon the ground and scored that self-same face.

One of the Hazards of scoring in the "Standard" method, is extreme stress upon one's back. It is for Darn sure, that after a day out Hewing, and, figuring that any given day of hewing is about two parts Swinging a Felling Axe, one part swinging a Broad Axe, and two parts Trying to see if there's any darn way to reverse that ratio. Well, let's just say that the day ain't gettin any longer, but you sure feel like it is, with you getting shorter to boot!

Hewing is a Pysically Brutal past-time, and scoring is a rather large element of that.
