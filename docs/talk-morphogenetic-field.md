# Talk:Morphogenetic field

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

All right, but what does the morphogenetic field *do*? How does it interact with life, and presumably DNA? Or is that just a bad name based on an earlier misinterpretation?

It's still used by Sheldrake although he uses [morphic resonance](/morphic-resonance) more generally. Read about it and related ideas from the [Baroque](/baroque) era and thereabouts at [Wikipedia: morphogenetic field](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-morphogenetic-field).

The term [epigenetics](/epigenetics) vs. [epigenetic](/epigenetic) is no worse in terms of bad naming.

*What follows is a description of morphogenetic field theory, as described by a previous Metaweb user who I can only assume is a believer.*

Assume away. I just summed up the theory. Follow the link on Sheldrake. [Sparky](/user-stsparky) 01:24, 2003 Dec 3 (PST)

The article is much better now, and much more so than the unreadable [Andrew Loeb](/andrew-loeb) which makes allusions that it seems a neophyte can't make without a vast body of strange arcane knowledge, or [corporate personhood](/corporate-personhood) which is not an article but a critique of an article. THe point of wikis is not to re-invent threaded dialogue, but rather, to list what is agreed on and what is factual, and then to attribute what is disputed.

A more detailed note here on the differences or similarities between [morphogenetic field](/morphogenetic-field) and [quantum entanglement](/quantum-entanglement) would be of value. Also [string theory](/string-theory) has similarities to both theories that could be explored and is a useful [Metaweb:troll bridge](/metaweb-troll-bridge) in case you wish to continue word fencing.
