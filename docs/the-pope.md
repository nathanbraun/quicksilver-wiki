# The Pope

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

The Prince of Christ, Bishop of Rome, "Da Popa", he is the leader of the Roman Catholic Church. The Pope is self-proclaimed to be infallible.

The Pope is referred to by some protestant sects as "The Whore of Babylon" (see [Cult of Asherah](/cult-of-asherah), in Snow Crash). Said sects promulgate a conspiracy theory that Simon Peter never went to Rome to establish the church, instead a satanic magician by the name of Simon Magus who was spurned by the Apostles did go there, impersonate Simon Peter, and create a 'false' church.

As [Hiro Protagonist](/hiro-protagonist) is told by the Librarian, the Cult of Asherah's metavirus compromised the Christian religion within a matter of days after the Crucifiction of Jesus.
