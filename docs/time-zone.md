### Community entry: Time Zone


[Quicksilver](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver)-pertinent information grabbed from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. 

Time zones are areas of the Earth that follow the same definition of time. Formerly, people used apparent solar time, resulting in the time differing slightly from town to town. Time zones partially rectified the problem by setting the clocks of a region to the same mean solar time. Time zones are generally centered on meridians of a longitude that is a multiple of 15ยบ; however as the map below shows, the shapes of time zones can be quite irregular because of boundaries of countries. 

All time zones are defined relative to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The reference point for Time Zones is the Prime Meridian (longitude 000) which passes through inside the Royal Greenwich Observatory in Greenwich, London, England [1]. The reference time was originally called Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), but is now referred to as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to distinguish it from the local time in London which may be adjusted for daylight saving time.
