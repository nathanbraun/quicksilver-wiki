## Definition


Matter Compilers assemble atoms from [The Feed](/the-feed) to create useful objects via a form of [nanotechnology](/nanotechnology) referred to as [MNT](/mnt). Matter compiling and the supply of raw materials to MC's is the primary form of economic activity in [The Diamond Age](/the-diamond-age) outside of [Intellectual Property](/intellectual-property) endeavours such as designing [nanomachinery](/nanomachinery), [rod-logic](/rod-logic) nanocomputers, or forms of artistic expression such as [Ractives](/ractives). 

Compiled products, for the most part, are generally for the mass market, and as such are regarded as of less value than hand made products such as those prized by Victorians (such as Hackworth's top-hat). Only compiled products can be decompiled by matter compilers, primarily because materials used in hand made products are made of far to broad a range of complex molecules, generally, for matter compilers to differentiate. It is left to the originators of [The Feed](/the-feed), in [High Victoria](/high-victoria) and other leased territories, to supply highly differentiated atomized raw materials, which they generally extract from sea-water.
