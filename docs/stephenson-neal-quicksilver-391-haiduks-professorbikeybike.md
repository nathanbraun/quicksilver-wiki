From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Serbs and Greeks never really accepted the Turkish invasion, and thus, those that chose to actively resist, were labeled *haiduks*, or outlaws. Haiduks were arguably not outlaws, as the law they broke were Turkish law, not their own. Haiduks would run ambushes on invading Turkish caravans, often with popular support from Serbian villagers.

It is interesting to note that [George Washington Hayduke](/george-washington-hayduke), the character in [Edward Abbey](/edward-abbey)'s novel *[The Monkey Wrench Gang](/the-monkey-wrench-gang)*, most likely got his name from the haiduks.
