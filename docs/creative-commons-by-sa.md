From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

**Creative Commons by-sa** is the usual name of the [Creative Commons](/creative-commons) [free documentation](/free-documentation) license that requires [attribution - who the article is "by"](/metaweb-attribution) and [share-alike or "sa"](/metaweb-share-alike) terms. It is often considered equivalent to the [GFDL](/gfdl) and some projects (like [Wikitravel](/wikitravel) use it instead of that license). However, the [GFDL text corpus](/gfdl-text-corpus) is distinct from the CCbysa corpus, and texts from the two cannot be mixed without permission of all attributed authors.

Also, the [GFDL](/gfdl) contains some [moral rights](/metaweb-moral-rights) terms regarding that are designed to prevent various repurposings of documents, or claiming rights to extensions of documents, that seem to be possible under CCbysa. Accordingly, negotiations are ongoing between [Creative Commons](/creative-commons) and [GNU](/gnu) regarding dual-licensing, which may lead to a variant of the CC-by-sa, which is acceptable to GNU as a strict equivalent of the GFDL. This may not happen soon, or ever.
