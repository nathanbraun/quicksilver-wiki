# Fluxions

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

*Method of [Fluxions](/fluxions)* was a book written in 1671 by [Isaac Newton](/isaac-newton) describing an efficient algorithm (the Newton-Raphson method) for finding approximations to the zero (or root) of a real-valued function. Although the book was completed in 1671, it was not published until 1736.

[Joseph Raphson](/joseph-raphson) in 1690 published his own version of this algorithm in [Analysis Aequationum](/analysis-aequationum). On the strength of this work he was elected to the [Royal Society](/royal-society) in 1691, a full year before he graduated from [Cambridge University](/cambridge-university).
