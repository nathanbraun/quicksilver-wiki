# Large public wiki

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

A **large public wiki** refers to a type of collaborative website created by a large number of users and which allows all users access both to post original content and to edit any existing content. A fundamental principle of a large public wiki is that anybody can edit anything. Granting such unfettered access allows documents to be created quickly and simplifies correcting errors. At the same time, unrestricted access makes this type of wiki an easy target for vandalism. The community of users creating a specific wiki will likely create a protocal for addressing problems like vandalism and spamming.
