## How do I edit a page?



It's quite simple. Simply click "Edit this page" on the bottom or the side of the page, and type away. See [How to edit a page](/wikipedia-how-to-edit-a-page) to learn about making links, using **bold** and *italics*, linking to images, and many other things...

## How do I make links?


 A link is just the name of the page surrounded by double square brackets. It's also possible to make the link display text that is different from that of the link itself: 
[[page name]]
[[page name]]s -- suffix text will display as part of the link
[[page name|display name]] -- the [piped link](/piped-link): hide the page name and display something else (but use this sparingly, and *never* "click here"!)
[[page name (disambiguation)|]] -- the "pipe trick": the part in parentheses will not be displayed.
NB You don't need to put underscores ("\_"), to act as space separators like you see in links. Spaces will work fine.

## How do I rename a page?



Registered users can move a page; this moves the page content and edit history to a new title, and creates a redirecting page at the old title. This method is better than just copying the content by hand, as it preserves the article's history. Use the "Move this page" link. If you want to move a page, please click the "What links here" and fix the links to the page in question. See [How to rename (move) a page](/wikipedia-how-to-rename-move-a-page).

## How do I edit a redirect page?



The easiest way to edit the redirected page is to click on the link you see at the top of the page after being redirected: "redirected from ...". For example, if you try to go to the [William Jefferson Clinton](/william-jefferson-clinton) page, you are redirected to the [Bill Clinton](/bill-clinton) page. At the very top of that page, you will see a message: "(redirected from [William Jefferson Clinton](/william-jefferson-clinton))", Click on the [William Jefferson Clinton](/william-jefferson-clinton) link, and you will edit the redirect page page. See [Redirect](/wikipedia-redirect).

**How do I figure out how big an article is? See, the advice on when an article should be split is in term of kilobytes, so I'd like to be able to check so that I'm not leaving articles too long and too stubby.**
Search results give the size, for example "Knot theory (3220 bytes)"

## How do I determine what other users have changed in an article?


 Wikipedia's software can produce a list of all the changes between two versions of an article (either between two consecutive versions, or between an old and the current version), laid out in two-columns side by side with changes highlighted. From the Recent Changes page you can click the "diff" link; from an article page itself click "Page history", then "cur" or "last" to see changes.

## How do I convert [unicode](/unicode) characters to [HTML](/html) special characters?


1. Edit the article just like you do UTF-8'd wiki sites.
2. Then hit preview. You should get broken characters or [mojibake](/mojibake) but don't delete them because they enable to convert unicode characters.
3. With keeping broken characters, type articles. You probably want to copy the entire article before removing it then paste it after you get broken characters.


## How can I put pictures on my pages?



If the picture is located on a server you control, you can refer to that image from your wiki page by simply including its URL, like this:
`http://my.webserver.com/image.png` and it will be included. (Note it will only be linked, not displayed.) If instead you want to upload a picture to wikipedia.org, you can use [special:upload](/special-upload) as a logged-in user and once it is uploaded, you can refer to it in your wiki pages as above, by including its file name :`[[image:NameOfImage.png|Alternate Text]]`. 

## How can I delete uploaded items?



Only [Wikipedia:Administrators](/wikipedia-administrators) can delete uploads, but anyone can upload a new item with the same name, thereby replacing the old one.


## How do I describe images?



Click on the image to get the description page. Also, when you upload the file everything you put in the upload summary is placed into the image's description page.
