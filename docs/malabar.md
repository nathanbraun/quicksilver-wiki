*[Queen Kottekkal](/queen-kottekkal), the pirate queen of Malabar, captures [The Cabal's](/the-ten) treasure ship (and treasure), several of its members (Jack, Foot, Esphahan and van Hoek jump overboard and escape), but eventually becomes a major backer for van Hoek's ship, [Minerva](/minerva). The Cabal wind up embezzling the gold back from her treasury, hidden as hull plating of the ship.*

Locally known for female pirates, it is the southern tip of India, below the region of [Hindoostan](/hindoostan) which [Jack Shaftoe](/jack-shaftoe) is king of for three years. [Enoch Root](/enoch-root) teaches Jack about realities in the local economy when he shows him the wootzvale. 

This ***imaginary*** country (though the Malabar Pirates were quite real in the day) was run by Queen Kottekkal at the time of ***Bonanza***, and its royalty falls among matrilinear lines. She basically is used as a very *interesting* banker as far as [the ten](/the-ten) are concerned. She gives interesting employment to [Dappa](/dappa) and the Jesuit [Gabriel Goto](/gabriel-goto). The Minyan has a cunning plan to take advantage of a *closed market*.
