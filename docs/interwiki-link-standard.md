# Interwiki link standard

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

An **interwiki link standard** is the internal link equivalent of a [standard wiki URI](/standard-wiki-uri). It has the following form:

[language:service:namespaces\_within\_service\_if\_any:page/subpage#section](/language-service-namespaces-within-service-if-any-page-subpage)

Under such a standard, links like [en:Wikinfo:standard\_wiki\_URI](/http-www-wikinfo-org-wiki-phtml-title-getwiki-talk-corpus-interwiki) would work automatically without the end user having to remember or look up an overly complex URI that may be specific to the service or software, omits or assumes language information, and omits or assumes information about the editability of the page, or its effective date. There is no way other than this also to link to a known version of a page, which is particularly important for publications.

It is not presently supported by [MediaWiki](/mediawiki) or [GetWiki](/getwiki) directly. Typically [ [ en: ] ] points to the Full English [Wikipedia](/wikipedia), so that  [en: Metaweb: phyle](/)  would point to a nonexistent Metaweb subspace of Wikipedia, not to [phyle](/phyle) as it should. The name of the service is assumed to be Wikipedia. This obviously retards the growth of more responsible services.

The vast number of links within the [GFDL text corpus](/gfdl-text-corpus), millions of them, mostly assume Wikipedia as the service. This must change to achieve any real management of that corpus beyond that one user interface and clique/cabal. As with lack of a [standard wiki URI](/standard-wiki-uri) for non-wiki XML and HTML pages, lack of an interwiki standard inhibits referencing and can only slow growth of the [Metaweb](/metaweb).

*See [en:Wikinfo:standard\_wiki\_URI](/http-www-wikinfo-org-wiki-phtml-title-getwiki-talk-corpus-interwiki) for a debate on the issue's relevance to [GetWiki](/getwiki) development, and [en: Recyclopedia: wikitext standard](/http-recyclopedia-info-wiki-wiki-phtml-title-wikitext-standard) for application issues.*

*Developers seem to be quite polarized: [Wikinfo](/wikinfo) refuses to discuss this in any context other than GetWiki development, predictably; Recyclopedia, Metaweb, Consumerium, are neutral. [Meta-Wikipedia](/meta-wikipedia) and [Wikipedia](/wikipedia) are only interested in discussing it in the context of [Mediawiki](/mediawiki), and likely most others don't care. This polarization probably impedes any standard.*
