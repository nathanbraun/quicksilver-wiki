### Dinosaur, Duck, Peter, and Purple


Nell's in stress about various things beyond her control and has too much fun with the MC. Working Class people such as Tequila use stuff made from their cheap *Feed* and Nellodee's mattress making would unleash too much whoop-ass upon those unable to defend themselves.

Dinosaur, Duck, Peter, and Purple were old ragged things that had been made "by hand" and as such can't be *deked*.

Anyone want to speculate on the identity of 'Purple' or 'Dinosaur?'

* **Duck** - Likely a rubber ducky of some sort.
* **Dinosaur** - I am afraid to speculate, but this writer believes that Dinosaur is a certain purple stuffed creature known in our age as [Barney](/barney), the anti-christ of childrens television programming.
* **Peter** - A Peter Rabbit of some form. Peter is smart and quick and a bit of a wise acre.
* **Purple** - A fairy princess or some form of good witch doll.
