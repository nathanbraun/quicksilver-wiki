The Solomon Islands were probably discovered by humans about 3000 BCE. The Solomon Islands are a nation in the South Pacific Ocean, east of Papua New Guinea and is part of the British Commonwealth. It consists of more than 990 islands, which together cover a land mass of 28,000 square kilometres. The Solomon Islands has an abundance of golden beaches fringed with palm trees, translucent blue waters, spectacular coral reefs and colourful marine life

The Spanish explorer Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa (He was "Master of the Route.") discovered the islands in 1568. Alvaro de Menda√±a de Neyra accompanied Sarmiento on this voyage. He wanted to take credit for the discovery and threw Sarmiento's maps and notes overboard naming the island group the Solomons. The first Europeans to visit the Islands were the Spanish with Alvaro de Mendana He also named the Islands of Santa Isabel, Guadalcanal and San Cristobal. Spain lost its interest in the islands late in the 16th century, when one of Alvaro's ships was lost on a second visit to the area. Later, Dutch, French and British navigators visited the islands; their reception was often hostile.

Missionary activity started at the mid 19th century and European colonial ambitions led to the establishment of a German Protectorate over the Northern Solomons, following an Anglo-German Treaty of 1886. A British Solomon Islands Protectorate over the southern islands was proclaimed in 1893. German interests were transferred to Britain under the Samoa Tripartite Convention of 1899, in exchange for recognition of the German claim to Western Samoa.
