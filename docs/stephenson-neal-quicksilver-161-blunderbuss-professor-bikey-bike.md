From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

A *blunderbuss* is an ancient and primitive sort of pistol. The short-barreled, large bore flintlock gun derives its name from the old Dutch words *donder* (thunder) and *bus* (gun). The widely flaring muzzle was designed to scatter shot at close range, making it a weapon of choice for home defense, as well as buccaneering and pirating. The British Sea Service (1790-1815) issued them as standard equipment since they could be shoulder fired or rail-mounted as a swivel gun.
### Quotations


Some may well ask what a blunderbuss was. Indeed, this very question, it is said, was put to the Four Wise Clerks of Oxenford, and after thought they replied: `A blunderbuss is a short gun with a large bore firing many balls or slugs, and capable of doing execution within a limited range without exact aim. (Now superseded in civilised countries by other firearms.)'
 J.R.R. Tolkein --*Farmer Giles of Ham* (Tolkein is here quoting the Oxford English Dictionary.)

Startled to see this definition, and I have to say that I think gentlemen of the 17th and 18th Centuries would be as well.

There is certainly such a thing as a "blunderbuss pistol" (at least to modern collectors), but the word is typically used to refer to a short shoulder-arm, not a one-handed firearm.

As for the flaring muzzle being designed to scatter shot; perhaps... but any short barrel could accomplish that well enough. What the funnel-like belled muzzle did, that no other design could, was facilitate rapid reloading (which was, of course, then done from the muzzle end) on a bucking coach-seat or rolling deck. Getting loose powder and shot in something like measured amounts into a narrow orifice and tamped into place was difficult enough even on steady ground in stressful situations. Doing so in unmeasured amounts could constitute a greater threat than the intended target.
