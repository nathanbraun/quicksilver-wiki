... Hackworth got all the news that was appropriate to his station in life, plus a few optional services: the latest from his favorite cartoonists and columnists around the world; clippings on various peculiar crackpot subjects forwarded to him by his father, ever anxious that he had not, even after all this time, sufficiently edified his son; and stories relating to the Uitlanders a subphyle of New Atlantis, consisting of persons of British ancestry who had fled South Africa several decades previously. Hackworth's mother was an Uitlander, so he subscribed to the service. ...

### Outsider


**[Uitlander](/)**, Dutch for 'foreigner', was the name given to the mainly British expatriate workers in the Boer South African Republic or Transvaal.
Uitlanders immigrated to the Transvaal in large numbers in the gold rush during the 1880s. By the turn of the century, the white male uitlander population numbered as many as 60,000, outnumbering the white male Boer population, and the government passed laws to restrict their enfranchisement.
This gave rise to considerable discontent amongst the uitlanders, and was used as a pretext for military invasion by the British. In 1895, Cecil Rhodes planned an invasion of the the Transvaal to coincide with an uprising of the uitlanders in Johannesburg. The Jameson Raid took place but Jameson's force was overpowered, and the expected uitlander uprising never took place. The raid contributed much to the build-up towards the Second Boer War.

### New South Africa: An [FOQNE](/foqne)/[Burbclave](/burbclaves)


We first see mention of New South Africa as a Burbclave in [Snow Crash](/snow-crash), particularly when [Hiro Protagonist](/hiro-protagonist) is interviewing the former President of the [Temporary Republic of Kodiak and Kenai](/temporary-republic-of-kodiak-and-kenai) at a [Snooze n' Cruise](/snooze-n-cruise) bar in northern Oregon. His interview is interrupted by a few NSA citizens who wish to know Hiro's ancestry as a pretext to initiating a hate crime against him. Given the tendency of North American NSA residents (with tendencies to conspiracy theories painting the British Crown as the bad guys) who may find paying homage to the neo-British royalty a problem, there may have been a split in NSA after Snow Crash over the issue of becoming a phyle of New Atlantis.
