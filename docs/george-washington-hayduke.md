# George Washington Hayduke

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Hero! Villian! A character from *[The Monkey Wrench Gang](/the-monkey-wrench-gang)* who has become the mascot of resisting development of the natural world.

More to come eventually.

An interesting aside, his name, while not confirmed, most likely comes from the term *[haiduk](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-391-haiduks-professorbikeybike)*.
