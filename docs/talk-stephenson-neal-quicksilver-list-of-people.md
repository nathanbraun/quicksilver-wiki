# Talk:Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:List of people

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.


## **REAL** VERSUS ***FICTIONAL***


It would be informative to have a notation to distinguish real people from history, fictional people, and quasi-historical people.[user:qoq](/user-qoq)

The [list of notable Baroque figures](/list-of-notable-baroque-figures) puts *fictional character*s in italics, and others not. Quicksilver characters could always be boldfaced, and that would not interfere with either the non/fiction italics, nor with the user interface colours and underlines normally associated with links. Sensible?
## ***Multilayered Bluffing Stratagy***


*Dappa* seems to be worth a mention for his "multi-layered bluffing stratagy" quip.  

As does the *[Mineva's](/minerva)* handy handed *[Captain van Hoek](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-captain-van-hoek)*.  


## ***MERCURY***


**Quicksilver** as 'Mercury' appears in several aspects -- in paintings and in metaphysical discourse. Mercury is mentioned as poison and possible [pox](/http-www-hyperdictionary-com-dictionary-syphilis) cure. Hermes is also linked to Alchemy -- as [Hermes Trismegistus](/http-en2-wikipedia-org-wiki-hermes-trismegistus) the thrice greatest -- as the teacher the magical system known as Hermetism of which *high magic* and [alchemy](/alchemy) are thought to be twin branches.
 Its funny to note that [Drake Waterhouse](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-drake-waterhouse)'s mutilated face with its lack of a nose shares the same fate that befalls some of those unGodly libertines seeking a pox cure.  


## ***Merciful MINERVA***


**[Minerva](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-12-minerva-alan-sinder)** AKA 'Athena' pops up too. She is a high tech ship (which must have had several incarnations if her crockery is *old* as **[Daniel Waterhouse](/daniel-waterhouse)** observed on page 92; And since we must believe 'Dappa the hipster' about Minerva being a Malabar Brigantine and not some mere *floaty* Flemish-style [boat](/http-www-qaronline-org-rcorner-genhistory-htm) that *zogs*1 when it shouldn't.

### page 92 wm. morrow edition



This is my first time to the site so I apologize if this has been well covered and I just can't find it! My copy of Quicksilver (Wm. Morrow) ends page 92 mid sentence! Can anyone fill me in on what comes after "...all of a sudden it's \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"??????

It's covered -- page 92 is Daniel on the Minerva and his memory takes him back to - The Plague Years which is the next chapter.
