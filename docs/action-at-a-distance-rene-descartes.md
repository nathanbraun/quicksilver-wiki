# Action at a distance (Rene Descartes)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Action at a distance is also known as "telekenisis", at least for psi adherents.

In Newton's time, his theory of instantaneous transmission of gravity was treated as 'action at a distance' by critics. This debate has not really changed much, as gravitons still are not detected, and Machs Principle, that the collective gravity of all the matter in the universe is what causes inertia (resistance to acceleration) hinges on the idea that a push signals into the distant future to the edge of the universe, then back in time for gravity to resist your push. Mind bending stuff.
