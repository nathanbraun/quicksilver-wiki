# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:11:Hypothesis of Vortices (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

[Descartes](/rene-descartes) and others, including (for
a while) [Leibniz](/gottfried-wilhelm-von-leibniz) sought to explain the orbits of planets by means of
[vortices](/vortices) in the [aether](/aether). It seems nutty to us, but was preferable to
them, on metaphysical grounds, to the notion of [action at a distance](/action-at-a-distance),
which is a bit troublesome even today. The comment quoted here is from
[Newton](/isaac-newton).
