*This character maybe a wink and nod to [Mack Reynolds](/)' idea of the new legit face of the [Mafia](/). He's good with a razor.*

### Briefly


In [Snow Crash](/snow-crash), **Uncle Enzo** is the Godfather of [Novo Sicilia](/stephenson-neal-snow-crash-03-cosanostra-pizza-university-mike-lorrey) as well as their friendly PR image. He is named for Enzo Ferrari like many young proud Italian Americans of his era. He served in Vietnam as a grunt to distance himself from his overprotective parents. He feels very avuncular about [YT](/yt). He is admirable for his adaptability and "hands on" leadership skills.
