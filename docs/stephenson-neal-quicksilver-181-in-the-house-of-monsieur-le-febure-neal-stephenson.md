# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:181:In the House of Monsieur Le Febure (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

It is well attested that Newton devoted a
lot of time to Alchemy and met frequently with fellow-Alchemists. The
details are quite obscure; that is, there's really no telling whom he
met with and when. Here I am building a story that is fictitious but
not too implausible. There was a Monsieur Lefebure (spellings vary)
and there were many Alchemists at the court of [Charles II](/charles-ii), including
the King himself. Here I am positing that a young [Newton](/isaac-newton) might have
been drawn into such circles.
