From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Mario Incandeza, second son of [wallace:david:infinite jest:character:James Orin Incandeza](/wallace-david-infinite-jest-character-james-orin-incandeza) and [Wallace:David:infinite jest:character:Avril Mondragon Incandeza](/wallace-david-infinite-jest-character-avril-mondragon-incandeza), brother (or maybe half-brother) of [Wallace:David:infinite jest:character:Hal Incandeza](/wallace-david-infinite-jest-character-hal-incandeza) and [Wallace:David:infinite jest:character:Orin Incandeza](/wallace-david-infinite-jest-character-orin-incandeza). Horribly, disfigured, short in stature, with "withered limbs", "reptillian head", "grayish skin", "the only one of J.O. and Avril Incandeza's offspring not wildly successful as a competitive athlete." Makes documentary films using a specially designed head-mounted Bolex movie camera, contolled with a foot treadle. Especially close to Hal Incandeza, whose room he shares at E.T.A. Devoted fan of the Maddam Pyschosis radio show, close confidant of Coach Schitt. Has had one, and exactly one, sexual experience in his life, involving U.S.S. Millicent Kent.

* some other interesting points about Mario Incandeza
	+ Mario is a homodont, meaning his dentition consists of only one type of tooth. Charles Tavis's circus dwarf grandmother is also described as a homodont. Furthermore, Charles Tavis thinks to himself (in horror) while on the treadmill that it is possible that he fathered Mario. Is Mario C.T.'s son?
