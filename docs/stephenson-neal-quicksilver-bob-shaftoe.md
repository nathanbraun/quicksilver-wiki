*It seems that as the Shaftoes are preternaturally quick to master military matters, and always manage to have a love/hate relationship with the top soldier of their era; Bob is the pointman for his era's Winston Churchill.*

### Community entry: Bob Shaftoe


One of three sons to  [Mother Shaftoe](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-mother-shaftoe), Elder Brother, and early companion of [Jack Shaftoe](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-jack-shaftoe). Bob, as did all the Shaftoe boys, began life as a [mudlark](/mudlark), under the tutelage of  [Jack Cole](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-jack-cole). Jack Cole's arrest, internment, and condemnation to hang, led the brothers on new paths of discovery, and a novel, new, and legal career choice, when commissioned by John Cole to speed, what would otherwise be, a slow death by Hanging.

Bob's journey through life would lead him from mudlark, to vagabond to a Sergeant in the [King's Own Black Torrent Guards](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-704-king-s-own-black-torrent-guards-neal-stephenson). 

He woos Abigail, a Taunton School girl, using his brother Jack's name.
