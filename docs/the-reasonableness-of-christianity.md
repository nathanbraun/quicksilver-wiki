# The Reasonableness of Christianity

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

[John Locke](/john-locke) based his ethical theories upon belief in the natural goodness of humanity. The inevitable pursuit of happiness and pleasure, when conducted rationally, leads to cooperation, and in the long run private happiness and the general welfare coincide. Immediate pleasures must give way to a prudent regard for ultimate good, including reward in the afterlife. He argued for broad religious freedom in three separate essays on toleration but excepted atheism and Roman Catholicism, which he felt should be legislated against as inimical to religion and the state. In his essay ***The Reasonableness of Christianity*** (1695), he emphasized the ethical aspect of [Christianity](/christianity) against dogma.
