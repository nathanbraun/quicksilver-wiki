From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

The world's greatest operating system. Developed in the late 60's by AT&T Bell Lab's researcers [Ken Thompson](/) and [Dennis Ritchie](/). History tells us that Thompson and Ritchie used some leftover hardware to write what amounted to a video game, and the result was the Unix kernel. 

Over the years, the Unix kernel was licensed to different companies who made it their own. [Sun Microsystems](/http-www-sun-com) developed SunOS (which was first based on Berkeley unix), [Silicon Graphics](/http-www-sgi-com) has IRIX, [IBM](/http-www-ibm-com) AIX. The [University of California at Berkeley](/http-www-berkeley-edu) rolled all of their changed into the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) unix, which spawned [FreeBSD](/http-www-freebsd-org), [NetBSD](/http-www-netbsd-org), [OpenBSD](/http-www-openbsd-org) and [BSDI](/http-www-bsdi-com). The Mach microkernel spawned [Macintosh](/http-www-apple-com) OS X, OS/2 and [Windows NT](/http-www-microsoft-com-windows). 

In the early 90s, a finnish student names [Linus Torvalds](/) started working on [his own version of the unix kernel](/http-www-linux-org), which us now running a major percentage of the hosts on the Internet.
