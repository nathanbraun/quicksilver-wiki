The Caesar cipher is the simplest form of substitution cipher. It consists of pairing up each letter of the plaintext alphabet to a letter of the cipher alphabet.

For example (taken from *The Code Book* by Simon Singh, 1999)

     Plaintext alphabet: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z  

     Ciphertext alphabet: D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C  


     Plaintext: v e n i, v i d i, v i c i  

     Ciphertext: Y H Q L, Y L G L, Y L F L  


It is claimed the earliest known reference to this type of cipher is in the *[Kama Sutra](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-kama-sutra)*, which says women should learn the art of secret writing to conceal their liasons. It was also used extensively by [Julius Caesar](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-julius-caesar) in his military campaigns, which is why it carries his name.

This type of cipher is easily defeated by [frequency analysis](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-frequency-analysis) and is superseded by [the vigenère cipher](/the-vigenère-cipher-talith).
