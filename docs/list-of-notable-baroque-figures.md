From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

*This list includes only figures from [European history](/european-history) and [European literature](/european-literature). Those in italics are fictional, or so we are told by that history. They might be real in [Quicksilver](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver)'s universe, or be secret identities of authors or others. History being what it is, we just can't know.
