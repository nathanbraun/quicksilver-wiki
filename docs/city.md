From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

 city 

* Coming through a cloud
* You're looking at me from above
* And I'm a revelation spreading out before your eyes
* And you find me beautiful and irresistible
* **A giant creature that forever seems to grow in size**
* And you feel a strange attraction
* The air is vibrant and electrified
* Welcome to me
* Here I am
* My arms are oh so **open wide**


* Somewhere **in the middle of the neverending noise**
* There is a constant **steady rhythm of a heart that beats**
* And a million voices blend into a **single voice**
* And you can hear it in the clamour of the crowded streets
* People come and take their chances
* Sometimes you win sometimes you lose a lot
* Come make your own contribution to this **melting pot**


* I'm the street you walk
* The **language** you talk
* I am the [city](/city)
* The skyline is [me](/me) and the [energy](/energy)
* I am the city
* The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
* And the funny [spells](/spells)
* And the turmoil the cars and the people
* The air that you're breathing is me
* Yes I am the city **you let me be**


* People [feed](/feed) me with their lives I am a hungry soul
* And they all worship [me](/me) and pay their homage day and night
* Every day I knew a lot of tired shopping feet
* But come the night they will be dancing in the neon light
* Dazzled by the crazy [magic](/magic)
* They're grabbing pieces of the fatted calf
* And in the wind if you listen hard you'll hear me laugh


* I'm the street you walk
* The [language](/language) you talk
* I am the city
* The skyline is **me** and **the energy**
* I am the city
* The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
* And the funny spells
* And the turmoil the cars and the people
* The parks and the squares that you see
* All the sounds that you hear
* And the air that you're breathing is me
* Yes I am the city **you let me be**


* I am the city
* **You let me be**
* I am the city


* The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
* And the funny spells
* And the turmoil the cars and the people
* The air that you're breathing is me
