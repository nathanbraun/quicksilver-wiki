It seems to be left carefully ambiguous whether or not Jack Shaftoe actually dies at the oar at the end of book two of Quicksilver? [Ashley Y](/user-ashley-y) 02:43, Nov 13, 2003 (PST)

There are farces of **"L'Emmerdeur" among the Barbary Pirates** later in the book ... so there is always hope.

## Jack as Catalyst


It is highly unlikely that "trouble makers" of this type die in this manner, that is, simply chained to an oar with nothing else happening. The presence of Jack aboard would very likely mean that the life experience of these pirates was about to radically change. The Author shows us Jack's life as a series of challenges which consistently increase in depth and complexity, it really is pretty much a messed up life, yet it is one of incredible magic.

The binding thread is that "things happen" around Jack, that he recognizes opportunities and acts upon them immediately. There are numerous examples of this throughout the book, not the least of which is his induction into the Austrian service, the presentation of Turk to him, or the meeting, and "rescue" of Eliza.

All of these are chance encounters. But I would strongly disagree with those who would say that Jack's Adventures merely served to introduce Eliza to the story, and that they served no other purpose beyond their entertainment value. I want to argue that Jack's life is included as a lesson for us all, but I do not really know why they are included. It's not a life that most can learn from, as it is derived from WHAT Jack is, more than any life choices he has made. Nature over Nurture.

To show that this is not merely a accident, or a character growing on its own, but rather a strong, and central, though perhaps hidden or secondary theme of the Authors we see the folllowing passage in "Cryptonomicon";

"Am I going to get to meet this character?" Randy asks, looking at the photograph.

Amy bites her lip and squints at the horizon. "Ninety percent of the time his prescence is a sign that something really wierd is going on." She holds the hatch for him, pointing out the high step.

"And the other ten percent?"

"He's bored, or on the outs with his girlfriend."

I've only just begun "Cryptonomicon", and so do not know how strongly this thread is explored there, but it does appear to have been included.

Also, the Main Figure in "The Diamond Age" is of the same character, or type, as Jack. 
We see her rise from a group that some might refer to as "Plate-Lickers", see her face extraordinary challenges, see her as somewhat of a catalyst, though, in some ways, the character of Jack is far more refined in it's telling, or at least clearer. Perhaps because he is more of a backdrop, a conduit, or an interlude, or, because the Author has, himself, experienced more, both in life and in his craft -- that of the written word.

Of course, it is just opinion, and, everyone is capable of being fooled. Some more than others. Tim B  [timberbee](/user-timberbee) 13:47, 31 Dec 2003 (PST)

### Secong Thoughts


It was to hasty for me to say that Only a Certain Type of person undergoes the type of struggles that Jack goes through.

A friend of mine would likely say that it was damn Bullshit, should I tell her. She would say that this is the Human condition. I recon that she is right.

Shit happens, challenges arise, we deal with what follows as best as we are able. But, how do we get to lead a life like this? This is NOT ordinary, despite how ordinary it Indeed is, maybe it is just not normal, for most of us who have our heads buried up our nether regions most of our lives.

In Jack's life, We don't simply see difficult situations occurring, we see IMPOSSIBLE situations occuring, entire chains of events that stretch credulity.

What's worse is that Jack recognizes and grasps each opportunity that arises, with precise timing, incredible cunning, yet an open heart, no trace of self - pity nor self - importance. He seems to be exactly what you see, a simple person in a relatively simple life, and yet,

#### So totaly Bizarre


It would seem Jack walks a line between two paths. One being that of the Saint -- where the World glistens in some beautiful, Divine light, air drawn in in rareified breaths, and the other being the path of the Beast -- walking as a Wolf in human form, every step a stalk, time, within, standing still, emotions miles away, and yet in touch, ever present. Every sound crisp, to dwell within oneself and yet be not apart from all that is, to be IN the moment, Every moment.

None of this would work if Jack was a Twit, or a fool, if he hid from life behind a shield of false humor, if he took nothing seriously, or Everything to seriously, with himself as center, and, if he cared what others thought, or if he lived either the life of a Doubter, or the life of a Fanatic. 

It would seem that THIS is the life that surrounds us. Incredible things being pulled out of our asses. Events always waiting to unfold at the exact precise times they need to. Challenges growing and growing. Each one greater than the last, each one stresses us to our very limits.

It's no wonder we bury ourselves in our works, or, in feeding our Cats, computer games, religion, televeision or books. That drugs, sex, and a dynamic social life can make ALL of this go away, such a blessing, at times.

Who in their right minds would lead a life such as this? Who would write it? And why? To write the Math end, to write the history of this book, it would seem that the Author would need to be well versed in those subjects, especially to bring it to life as he has. There are text books which can lay out the various notations and formulas, experts and scholars to draw upon, witness of history, recorded for posterities sake, 

But, where is the basis for Jack's extraordinary life? Admit that it makes seamless sense, this story of Jack the Author Delights us with. Though most of us would not desire to lead the life portrayed within, is it not within our grasp should we so choose? But, where do we start? Perhaps just as importantly for Jack, is there a way to make it stop once begun?
##### Addendum


It would seem that there is a way to make it stop. When passion is no longer involved, when it is Fear that dominates, rather than Heart, then, it would seem, a way out is inevitable. And the way back on? To reverse one's trend? To rekindle a fire, a TRUE fire, or... to struggle BACK to that place, to be, if not one who burns with each moment, then, Again, a Seeker?

Jack is the ***Sword of Devine Fire***? Venus is linked to Phosphorus and [Enoch Root](/enoch-root). Hmm Hmm.

Yeah, hope I didn't blow any of the story for you. Pg561 of the US hardbound edition. Say, since that takes place in Confusion and not Quicksilver, should I move that info to another page? - [Armaced](/user-armaced)

 We're cool - I've had the British HB and Paperback since 4/07/04 ... But now you've got to write an entry on his latest alias  He gives himself yet another one by the end of the book - [Sparky](/user-stsparky) 21:40, 2004 May 26 (PDT)

## Sean Partry


While I was reading The System of the World, I didn't realize that the surname [Partry](/partry) had already been mentioned in the books. --[Quinbus Flestrin](/user-quinbus-flestrin) 11:27, 31 Dec 2004 (PST)
