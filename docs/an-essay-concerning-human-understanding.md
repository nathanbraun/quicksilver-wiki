### [Wikipedia: An Essay Concerning Human Understanding](/)


An *Essay Concerning Human Understanding* is one of [John Locke](/john-locke)'s two most famous works, the other being his *[Second Treatise on Civil Government](/second-treatise-on-civil-government)*. Written in 1690, the essay concerns the foundation of human knowledge and understanding. He describes the mind at birth as a blank sheet, or *tabula rasa*, being filled later through experiences. The essay contributed to the growth of rationalism in the 18th century, and influenced philosophers such as Hume and Kant.

New Essays on Human Understanding, a chapter-by-chapter rebuttal of the book was written by [Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz](/gottfried-wilhelm-von-leibniz), the same year as Locke's death.
