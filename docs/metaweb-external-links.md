# Metaweb:External links

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

**[Metaweb](/metaweb) External links** should be chosen very carefully to illustrate exactly the point made in the [communal entry](/metaweb-communal-entry), or challenge it directly. It can also be used to justify the scope of the topic as a whole. It would be useful to include the following as such links:

* [Wikipedia](/wikipedia) articles
* [Disinfopedia](/disinfopedia) articles
* Encyclopedia Britannica articles
* credible news sources
* credible academic papers
* surveys of whole fields of study


In general, links to [conspiracy theory](/conspiracy-theory) sites or self-published "news" should probably be avoided.
