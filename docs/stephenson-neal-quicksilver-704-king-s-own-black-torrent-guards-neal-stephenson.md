# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:704:King's Own Black Torrent Guards (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

This regiment is fictitious, however it is true that several of the oldest British regiments, such as the Coldstream Guards, were founded during this era. I have tried to make the story of the King's Own Black Torrent Guards plausible by patterning it after such real-world regiments.
