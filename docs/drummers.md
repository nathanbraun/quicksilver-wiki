From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

 drummers 
n [raver](/), [ravers](/)

In [The Diamond Age](/the-diamond-age), the Drummers are a [FOQNE](/foqne) of drug-addled, undersea dwelling polyamorous 24/7 ravers who have created a technology by which nanites infesting their bodies utilize the Drummers orgy/rave ceremonies to perform vastly distributed neural network computations on very large and difficult problems. [John Percival Hackworth](/john-percival-hackworth), the Artifex/Alchemist, spends time among them as penance for getting caught up in the machinations of the Old Kingdom, but operates as a spy for the Victorian government.

It is theorized that the [CryptNet](/) high level operatives, like [PhyrPhox](/phyrephox) use the Drummer collective network as their personal computer system for the "tuple processing" that they are hired to do.
