# Image:Shallow wide.png

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Several baroque era family trees: Angleseys, Bolstroods, the Silver branch Comstocks, and a bunch of bastards.

I started this when I had the vague feeling de Gex was related to duc d'Arcachon. Now I can see that de Gex's cousin married d'Arcachon's bastard son.

I'm leaving out spoilers as best as I can. I may need to remove some dates & rearrange a bit; I'll post the [printable pdf](/image-shallow-more-wide-pdf) but not the source until I'm content.
