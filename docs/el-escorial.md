From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

**El Escorial** is an immense [palace](/palace), [monastery](/monastery), [museum](/museum), and [library](/library) complex located at **San Lorenzo de El Escorial** (also *San Lorenzo del Escorial*), a town 45 kilometres northwest of [Madrid](/madrid) in the [autonomous community of Madrid](/madrid-autonomous-community) in [Spain](/spain).

At the foot of the [Sierra de Guadarrama](/sierra-de-guadarrama) [mountain range](/mountain-range), the complex was commanded by King [Philip II of Spain](/philip-ii-of-spain) as a [necropolis](/necropolis) for the Spanish monarchs and the seat of studies in aid of the [Counter-Reformation](/counter-reformation). It was designed by the architects [Juan Bautista de Toledo](/juan-bautista-de-toledo), [Giambattista Castello](/giambattista-castello), and [Juan de Herrera](/juan-de-herrera) in an austere classical style, and built from [1563](/1563) to [1584](/1584). 

It is shaped as a [grid](/grid) traditionally explained as a memory of the martyrdom of [Saint Lawrence](/saint-lawrence). It is said that during the [battle of Saint Quentin](/battle-of-saint-quentin), the Spanish troops destroyed a small [hermitage](/hermit) devoted to Lawrence. The King decided to dedicate the monastery to the saint in thanks for his victory.

Another explanation is that it is an adaptation of the [Temple of Solomon](/temple-of-solomon) as described by [Flavius Josephus](/flavius-josephus).
Two statues of [David](/david) and [Solomon](/solomon) are placed to each side of the church as a parallelism with the warrior [Charles V](/charles-v) and the prudent Philip.
A fresco in the center of the library presents Solomon in his most wisdom: with the [Queen of Sheba](/queen-of-sheba).

The complex has an enormous store of art, including works by [Titian](/titian), [El Greco](/el-greco), [Velázquez](/diego-velazquez), [Goya](/francisco-goya), and others. Also at the complex is a library containing thousands of priceless ancient [manuscripts](/manuscript), including Philip's [alchemy](/alchemy) collection. It is the burial site for most [Spanish kings](/list-of-spanish-monarchs) since Philip II.

The complex is a [UNESCO](/unesco) [World Heritage Site](/world-heritage-site) and is an extremely popular tourist attraction, often visited as a day trip from Madrid. It is close to the [Santa Cruz del Valle de los Caídos](/santa-cruz-del-valle-de-los-caídos).

The surrounding town of San Lorenzo de El Escorial (Madrid) is also home for the popular summer courses of [Universidad Complutense](/universidad-complutense).
A downhill neighbour town also named El Escorial has a likenamed [RENFE](/renfe) station.
