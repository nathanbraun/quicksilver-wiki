From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

It is interesting to note that when Isaac was born he was so small that his mother commented that "he might haved been put into a quart mug" and so weak that no one thought he would live beyond a couple of days.

At the age of twelve he attended public school at Grantham but performed poorly with his prescribed studies instead showing keen interest in mechanical items such and waterwheels, clocks and such.

He lasted only two years at Grantham.
