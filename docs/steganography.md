Steganography describes methods for transmitting messages which hide the fact that there is a message--such as munging the low bits of each pixel in an image to encode a message. It is a form of [Security by Obscurity](/security-by-obscurity), although the message itself may be encrypted in a separate step.

The word 'steganography' comes from the Greek *steganos*, meaning 'covered', plus *graphein*, meaning 'writing.' (Compare to cryptography, meaning 'hidden writing'.) The word first appeared in English in 1569 in James Sanford's  *Of the vanitie and uncertaintie of artes and sciences* , a translation of Agrippa's "De incertitudine et vanitate scientiarum", first published in 1527. (Agrippa's book is a sprawling and sometimes confusing denunciation of Catholic orthodoxy).
