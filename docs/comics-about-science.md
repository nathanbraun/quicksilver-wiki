**[Some of Jim Ottaviani's outstanding output](/http-www-gt-labs-com-interview-html)**
[Jim Ottaviani](/http-www-gt-labs-com-sitemap-html) involves the whole brain in his comics. Starting as a reviewer and interviewer for trade magazines, he moved to the other side of the creative fence
in 1997 with the publication of ***Two-Fisted Science***. He has then won awards for ***Dignifying Science*** (stories about women scientists) and ***Fallout: J. Robert Oppenheimer, Leo Szilard, And The Political Science of the Atomic Bomb***. His most recent book, to appear this summer, is ***Suspended in Language***, a 320 page (plus a color supplement) biography of Niels Bohr, the father of quantum physics.
