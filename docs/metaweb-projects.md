## content



* **[Annotations.PDF](/http-www-frontier-iarc-uaf-edu-cswingle-baroque-cycle-annotations-pdf)**


* [Sparky's Book List](/sparky-s-book-list)


* Beg [Neal Stephenson](/neal-stephenson) to release [Young Lady's Illustrated Primer](/young-lady-s-illustrated-primer) from [Diamond Age](/diamond-age) under [GFDL](/gfdl) or (better) dual GFDL and [Creative Commons by-sa](/creative-commons-by-sa), so that we can complete it, and release it to real girls lacking primary school education access in real India and real China. It might also be of use to children in western countries, given the disintegration the quality of public education in the US particularly, to provide home schooling to children in inner cities. Stephenson better go patent the idea, though, if he wants to keep it in the public domain. With cell phone/pda technology today, we have the capability now of a fully ractive primer, where ractors would bid on work via an eBay/eLance type system and interact with children and their primers via the cellular networks.


* Form a consortium to better manage the [GFDL text corpus](/gfdl-text-corpus) as a whole. It may be wisest to work with [Internet Encyclopedia](/internet-encyclopedia) on this, as it is English-only but also supports multiple [point of view](/point-of-view) (like [Metaweb](/metaweb)). Also, [Consumerium](/consumerium) is intent on developing a fair formal system of resolving multiple views into one version that an individual consumer can trust, based on their own personal values. This may be useful in our content management too, if we actually care about the user seeing things they consider trustworthy to be a priority.


## editing



* Difference, if any, between a Stephenson [phyle](/phyle) and a [Metaweb:phyle](/metaweb-phyle), and comparing with related concepts elsewhere, e.g. [Consumerium concept of faction](/http-consumerium-org-wiki-wiki-phtml-title-faction), [OurAnswer.org's concept of faction](/http-ouranswer-org-wiki-index-php-ouranswer-faction), Wikipedia attempt at generic arbitrarion model without factions or phyles (failing badly, it seems), and [Recyclopedia](/recyclopedia)'s more anarchist "direct democracy with faction fallback"


* Comparing [Metaweb:intermediate page](/metaweb-intermediate-page) format with related projects elsewhere, e.g. [Consumerium's format](/http-consumerium-org-wiki-wiki-phtml-title-consumerium-intermediate-page-format)



* A real [wikitext standard](/wikitext-standard)


## access



* Surveying alternate technologies to suck in intermediate pages and manage editing, which do more than [mediawiki](/mediawiki), but might require custom coding; Consider replacing mediawiki with the much more functional [GetWiki](/getwiki) - see [http://internet-encyclopedia.org/wiki.phtml?title=Wikinfo:GetWiki](/http-internet-encyclopedia-org-wiki-phtml-title-wikinfo-getwiki)


* Making pages accessible from [mobile devices](/mobile-device), e.g. using [Python](/python) which is now supported by Nokia and PalmOS


* Define some [Metaweb:public library](/metaweb-public-library) and [Metaweb:bookstore](/metaweb-bookstore) interfaces useful in these locations where people consult books and may have mobile devices on hand, or where computers may be accessible to provide additional information; Consider working more closely with [Consumerium](/http-consumerium-org-wiki) on such problems as [book buy](/http-consumerium-org-wiki-wiki-phtml-title-buy-book)ing, possibly extending them to support [Metaweb:public library](/metaweb-public-library) functions for books one is not about to buy, but is consulting or about to read.
