# Interwiki identity standard

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

An **interwiki identity standard** fuses a [standard wiki URI](/standard-wiki-uri) for [users](/wiki-user-page), with a [interwiki link standard](/interwiki-link-standard) for [attribution](/attribution) links.

It would be a major component of a [wikitext standard](/wikitext-standard) and may be a step towards a [person DTD](/http-meta-wikipedia-org-wiki-wiki-phtml-title-person-dtd) to unambiguously identify a given person and claims regarding, or made by, that person.

It has been proposed by both [MediaWiki](/mediawiki) and [GetWiki](/getwiki) developers. The most likely candidate is a [jabber.org](/jabber-org) ID. Users would login with this, and it would replace the [IP number](/ip-number) or [Mediawiki-based service](/mediawiki-based-service) account, both of which have serious [identity dispute](/identity-dispute) problems, to self-assert an identity.

Only [factions](/faction) could deal with collective or alleged identity, however.

*See [en:Wikinfo:interwiki identity standard](/http-www-wikinfo-org-wiki-phtml-title-interwiki-identity-standard) for a debate on the issue's relevance beyond [Wikipedia](/wikipedia). See also [en:GetWiki\_talk:Corpus](/http-www-wikinfo-org-wiki-phtml-title-getwiki-talk-corpus) for a fictional pan-[GFDL text corpus](/gfdl-text-corpus) RecentChanges log that illustrates some of the problems that necessarily arise without such a **standard**.*
