From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

A stab at what the [Qwghlmian](/qwghlm) alphabet1 might look like, based on the brief description in [Cryptonomicon](/cryptonomicon). Red glyphs bear a particularly tenuous connection to the forms described in the book.

Variations on the same glyph are grouped together in blue boxes.


1. Though, since (according to page 828 of [Quicksilver](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver)) it contains no vowels, it is technically an [abjad](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-abjad).
