# Star Wars Episode I

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

The Trade Federation (evil alien Japanese type folk) blockades Naboo to force them to accept imports and taxes. This is just a foil for Palpatine (evil leader type despot) to size control of the senate by gaining the support of Princess Amidala to obtain a majority. Evil stuff and lots of CGI happens afterwards.
