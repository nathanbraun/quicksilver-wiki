From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

It googles fine:  
  

Oh, I come from a land, from a faraway place  

Where the caravan camels roam  

Where they cut off your ear  

If they don't like your face  

It's barbaric, but hey, it's home  

  

When the winds from the east  

And the sun's from the west  

And the sand in the glass is right  

Come on down, stop on by  

Hop a carpet and fly  

To another Arabian night  

  

Arabian nights  

Like Arabian days  

More often than not  

Are hotter than hot  

In a lot of good ways  

  

Arabian nights  
 
'Neath Arabian moons  
 
A fool off his guard  

Could fall - and fall hard  

Out there on the dunes

"[Watered steel-blade](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-391-watered-steel-blade-neal-stephenson), the world perfection calls, 
Drunk with the viper poison foes appals,
Cuts lively, burns the blood whene'er it falls; 
And picks up gems from pave of marble halls;"
Strike with thy stubborn steel, and never fear 
Aught save the Godhead of Allmighty Might;
And shun ill practices and never show 
Through life but generous gifts to human sight.
