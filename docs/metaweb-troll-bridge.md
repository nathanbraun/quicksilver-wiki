# Metaweb:Troll bridge

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

A **troll bridge** is an article on which two [trolls](/metaweb-troll) can work without their usual level of rancor, and come to agree on facts, dates, and other neutral information. This is a good distraction from more theoretical or abstract or political material where they might not agree.

Finding such bridges is one way to overcome a [Metaweb:political dispute](/metaweb-political-dispute).
