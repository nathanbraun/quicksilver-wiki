### Traditional Timber Framing


Traditional Timber Framing is the construction of a super-structure, composed of timbers, fastened through the use of joinery  such as mortise and tennons, step laps, scarves, etc.  so connected in order to form a single, integral, body which receives, distributes and resolves the forces exerted upon any one element throughout the whole.

### Tradition - Upon the Shoulders of Giants


A Traditional Structure must utilize the materials, labor, knowledge and skill, available to the craftsmen, in order to meet the immediate needs, and Demands, of the community, in a timely, and economic fashion, relative, to that particular structure. 

Within this framework, it must be  **Consistent**  with the general principles of craft, this is the great link between the grandest, and the most humble.


To fulfill this, Traditional Craft has evolved, shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand, with Mankind. We are its originators, practioners, beneficiaries, and, ultimately, its servants. We serve Craft, which, Directly, serves the needs of the community, whatever, and wherever, that community is. From the dwellings of Bali to the Sky Scrappers of Manhattan, the shanty towns of Brazil, the row houses of Boston, to the cardboard boxes of the homeless everywhere. 

Ultimately, the Traditionalist is not unlike the Modern Scientist, in that, we too, stand upon the shoulders of Giants, refining, adapting, and expanding the systems which were bequeathed to us. We do not re-invent the wheel with each passing generation. Balloon Framing is the child of Timber Framing, as is, ultimately, stick framing. And, in the bones of the skyscrapers, our past shows most clearly, for there, even in these most modern of beasts, is the naming, and ordering of the craft preserved, easily seen, for all those who care to look.

Humans are builders. Designs, methods, and techniques from Africa, Asia, Europe, The Americas to the far flung, the scattered islands of the Pacific share a common, and dynamic bond. They came forth from the Human Hand.

## The Bones and Blood of Craft- Design




Traditional Design is a process of Discovery and Refinement which stretches back, into the Dawn of man. It is not attributable to one person, nor even one culture, though one may hope to add to the Body of knowledge which is passed on to future generations. this is not something over which we have control. 

Craft, acting as a living body, responds to the needs of those it serves, adding to itself that which serves those needs, removing that which does not. This, much to the amazement of idealists, may well mean the apparent depreciation of the craft, if this is what is required.

We cannot hold onto craft.

It does not Serve us, we serve it, and has needs of it's own, needs we are often not privy to, as craftsmen, and could not always comprehend, nor agree with, were they made known to us.

Some might say that this is the resulting death of the "Craftsman" period, a period, said by many, to have been wrought with hypocracy. I would agree.

I see the transformation of my craft to the state in which it exists today, as proof of this; Stick - Framing. 

Traditional Timber Framing, as I practice it today, is not able to serve the needs of the, larger, community as a whole. 

Yet I see my craft as far more relevant, and, Directly related to stick framing, and Steel work, than it is to the many, "Invented" systems of Modern, American, Timber Framing, which seeks to create itself anew.

While conventional carpentry has it's roots in Traditional Timber Framing, as does, in very obvous forms, steel work, Modern Timber Framing, does not. That it does not, also, serve the needs of the community, is, in my opinion, the reason for it's ever ongoing transformation, into something more and more foreign, with each passing day.

But, that is only my opinion.

Humans are builders. Designs, methods, and techniques from Africa, Asia, Europe, The Americas to the far flung, the scattered islands of the Pacific share a common, and dynamic bond. They came forth from the Human Hand.

The Traditional Timber Framing systems we have, in this country, The Dutch, the English, the French, the German, the American, The Native American and, lately more still, expanding from the original European / American, to encompass every land on Earth, are incredible, in the ways they resolve the forces which act upon them. 

More incredible still, in that they often evolved from very limited means, making due with what was available; short timbers, instead of long, Or, sometimes, **No timbers at all**, bronze tools instead of steel, stone, and bone instead of bronze, Mud, and dung, rather than wood and stone. 

In each case systems arose which, through often incredibly complex and efficient means, acted to balance need vs. economy, and do so in, very often, tremendously Holistic manners.

Most of the Traditional European Designs immediately changed, upon their introduction to the Americas, reflecting the differing demands of their transplanted communities, and the vastly different resources available to them.

One thing which did not change was the overall way in which these structures resolved load.

Most European Structures are perpetually at rest. Which means that they are not acting in a continual struggle simply to remain standing, not unlike the Human Body. Most traditional structures are placed in modes of resistance Only when acted upon by dynamic forces; The greater the force, the greater the resistance.

## Types of Yards

* [The Hewing Yard](/the-hewing-yard-timberbee)
* [The Sawing Yard](/the-sawing-yard-timberbee)

* [The Layout Yard; Scribe Rule](/the-layout-yard-scribe-rule-timberbee)
* [Storing the Finished Frame](/storing-the-finished-frame-timberbee)


## Organization


Seven Basic questions in determining the Overal Layout of a Yard;
* **Time Frame**
* **purpose**
* **Access**
* **Material Handling Methods**
* **Layout System Used**
* **Hand tool, Power Tool, or, Stationary Tool**


### Timeframe



* **Temporary Sites** - If the Site is purely situational; say the Frame will be cut where it later be erected, then a great deal of the organization will depends upon the unique methodologies peculiar to that particular builder, Factors such as access, shared space, Liability, Schecduling concerns of vendors and subcontractors will be the determining factors.

In this case, the Yard will grow as a living entity, it will live and breathe, and then, Die, once the project is completed, and all, in between, it will seem to have a unique personality, merely bearing a resemblance to those who inspired it, 

* **Permanent Sites** - Fixed Sites are Vastly different than Situational Sites. For one thing they tend to Serve Only One builder or One shop, and will, therefor, bear the Mark of those they serve, But, like Temporary Sites, Permanent Sites are also Very much like a Living Being, though they do not tend to be as Dynamic as Job sites, they will change, and flow, as needs, and conditions, do.


### Purpose



### Access



### Material Handling Methods


* [Moving Timber by Hand](/the-bull-of-the-woods-moving-timber-by-hand-timberbee)
* [Material Handling Trucks](/material-handling-trucks-and-the-yard-timberbee)
* [Fork Trucks, Tractors, and HorsePower](/fork-trucks-tractors-and-horsepower-timberbee)

### Layout System


* **Scribe Rule** - Of all the Layout Systems, Scribe Rule is the Most Space, and Labor Intensive, Generally, it requires it's Own yard, the " [Scribing Yard](/the-layout-yard-scribe-rule-timberbee)", or, Scribing Floor. And this yard, typically, must be kept free, so timbers are brought here, laid out, removed, cut elsewhere, and elements of One layup are returned to take their place in other layups.


* **Square Rule** - Square Rule is the Most flexible system mentioned, in terms of what it needs, and where it can be done. The Complications which can arise arise depend largely on the tooling used, and, a Factor not yet mentioned, Weather.


* **"Mapping"** - Mapping is an oddball. It is as Flexible in it's space requirements as Square Rule, however, since it is a more modern system and, is *Not* a Traditional System, in any way whatsoever, it is often practiced with a myriad of power Tools. And it is the tools themselves which, largely, determine how and where the cutting is done -- Often under Shelter.


### Hand Tool, Power Tool, or, Stationary Tool


Tooling is one of the Largest Determining Factors of all.   
At the most flexible end of the spectrum is a Shop which practices Square Rule, and used nothing but Hand Tools.

* **Hand Tools**- Issues such as Weather, Access, Handling Methods, Timeframe, Purpose, and Weather, have the least affect on how such a Yard is organized. As, such a shop could fell a Tree, Hew it where it falls, lay it out, cut it and drag it out of the woods, regardless of where that is, from the Everglades to Siberia or Patagonia. Wherever a Human Being can function, and where Trees exist, is a viable work space for such a crew.


* **Power Tools** - Add a layer of requirements. The first is the need for Power. The flexibility on what supplies that Power depends greatly upon the requirements of the individual tool. The needs of a Maffel Three-Phase 10" Circular Saw, are far different than those of a Makitta 110v 16" Circular Saw, still different are the needs of a gas powered saw, say, a standard chainsaw, which carries it's power plant with it -- Similar to a Human Being.


* **Power For the Power Tool**; Sourcing power can be answered in a number of ways, from the Conventional manner of "Hooking into the Grid" to the use of various generators, from the portable shop generator to the Larger, more stationary, [China Diesel Generators](/http-www-generatorpro-com-china-diesel-generator-aspx)

The question of Three phase can be answered with Three-Phase converters, should that service not be available localy (Check with local regulations).

Alternatives such as [Wind](/http-www-eere-energy-gov-re-wind-html), [Solar](/http-www-eere-energy-gov-re-solar-html) and [Water](/http-www-eere-energy-gov-re-hydropower-html) Power are also available, and greatly extend the zones in which Small scale power tools can be used.

* **Shelter From the Storm**; Unlike Most Handtools, A power tool cannot be, wiped down, tuned up and be expected to work well After having been subjected Hurican conditions, Sand Storms, or after having been recovered from a MudSlide. Most Power Tools require at least a minimum level of protection from the elements, in order to continue functioning at top effeciency. They also require more General care, and protection from Dampness, than do most Handtools. Though all Tools should be protected from rusting, Or, over drying, Handtools are, typicaly, not as delicate as the average Power Tool, in addition. The Repair, and Re-Tuning, of a Handtool is often Well within the capabilities of the craftsman using it. Not so with most of the Power Tools in use. It's a [Rare](/http-www-vtf-com-paul-profile-html) Individual who takes their Router apart in order to turn it's Armature on a lathe at home, in order to restore it to life.



* **Stationary Tools** - Are the Most limiting, and defining, aspect of Organizing a Yard. They have all the requirements of their smaller cousins, Power, and shelter, and add one of their own;  *the Need to be Fed.*


## Industrial Timber Framing


New tooling, such as the [[Hundegger](/http-www-hundeggerusa-com)], thrusts the cutting of the timber frame into the realm of Commercial Production. Though some of the machines are relatively small, it is still more appropriate to study Industrial production methods, rather than Craft, or trade methods when looking to organize a site for efficently using such a tool.

## Joinery



Joinery is always a compromise. As such it does not merely stand by itself, considerations for design must include, not only what the individual joint must bear, but, how it must act in the frame as a whole.

A Wedged Half-Dovetail Through tennon, used to secure the Tie Beam to the Wall Post in a Dropped Tie Carriage Barn must be strong enough, not only to bear the weight of the Tie, it's dead and Live loads, but also to resist the outward thrust placed on the Post as the roof presses upon the Plate it supports, as it attempts to settle downward.

For itself, the Mortise, and the *Housing*, must be concerned about too greatly diminishing the strength of the post, thus weakening it to the point where it could not resist the various forces acting against it.

In the Best of all worlds, the Wedged Half-Dovetail Through tennon would be the full width and Height of the Tie Beam; To preserve the Full strength of the Tie, and the Mortise would be non-existant; thus preserving the full strength of the Post. But, in reality, this cannot exist, so a compromise must be reached.

Due to the Nature of Wood, because Trees are composed of strands of Fibers, running from Root to Leader, compromises are possible, length is less of an issue than Width -- Strength wise -- in the Design of a joint.

In the case of the Wedged Half-Dovetail Through tennon, the tennon is Able to be the Full Height of the Tie Beam, no matter How tall the Tie Beam is, because, once those columns of Fibers have been severed, the damage is done.

The flip side of this, is the desire to preserve as Many Continuous strands as possible. To help achieve this, several things are done in traditional joinery;

* **Joints are limited to, and grouped in, "Lines"**; One joint Above the other, existing within that same "Severed" line as the ones below.

* **Joints are Rectangular in Nature, rather than Square.**The Width of the Joints is generally Very limited. The Conventions in the United states are Generally Multiples of 1 1/2" and 2"; These also happen to be the dimensions of the Tongue and the Body, respectively, of the Framing, or Rafter, Square -- first known by the name of "Pattern".

In addition to this, effort is made to preserve the outside edges of a given Timber, though notable exceptions do exist; such as drop in pockets in the upper face of a Tie Beam, step laps on the upper, and outside faces, of the Wall Plate, and the occasional use of a Lapped Dovetail Brace in a Post.

* **Note;** *Lap joints, of Any nature, require the outside face of the Receiving Timber to be pierced.*

In situtions where the fibers in the outer faces must be cut, consideration is given to how this affects the timbers ability to handle, and transmit, the forces acting upon it. In many cases the only solutions are to either increase the Bulk of the piece, or, to add intermediate supports, such as greater bracing (i.e.; Longer, steeper, heavier, load bearing braces, or multiple braces), Curtain walls, which will act to share some of the load, if and when the supported timber deflects, or intermediate Posts. These are *Some* of the solutions Traditional Systems have employed in the solving of certain Joinery Concerns -- "Compromise".

### Sills


The sills are, very simply, the Timbered element, which the Building sits upon. They are the transition between Earth, and Sky. For below them, is stone, supported by Earth, Above them rests the frame, a forest of Boles, linked, which, together, as a body, break the Plane of Sky, wind, and Weather.

* **Long Sills;** are so called as they run parallel to the Ridge -- the Center line of the building. Though, this line is not Always the longest dimension of a structure, those Sills which lie on this edge of the frame, the eaves side, are typically called the "Long Sills".

* Long sills, generally, also carry the  [Stub Mortises](/stub-mortise) into which the  [Stub Tennons](/stub-tennon) on the bottoms of the Wall Posts rest in.

```
 

```
* **Cross Sills;** is the typical name for those sills which run parallel to the Tie Beams.

There can be, very great, variations in the manner in which sills are assembled, and organized. The Joints linking them can range from extremely complex to very simple, with simple Butt Cutts; joined with fastners such as metal strapping, nails or bolts, to the most basic of Lap joints, the Half-lap.

A common convention in many, early, Square Rule barns throughout the New England region is that the Cross Sill is joined to the Long Sill by use of the Mortise and Tennon. The Sections of Sills, themselves, may be joined using anything from the simple Half-Lap to some of the more elaborate scarf joints. 

Throughout New England Sills were some of the, very last, vestiges of Timber Framing to be replaced in the "Conventional" House; The Balloon Frame.   
A stone foundation, beneath a "Modern" house is often a sign that, although the rafters, studs, and joists, are of dimensioned lumber, the sills may well be Heavy Timber, indeed, that is often highly likely to be the case

### Apprentices, Stories of the beginning


One of my favorite things to do, is to listen to listen to people's stories, especially stories of work, and what's more interesting than how someone got started, in the first place? 

There aren't many women folk in Timber Framing, well, not proper anyway, so, when I run into a Woman builder, well, you know, she's gonna have a story, and, it's probably gonna be a pretty good one. 

That sure was the case with a Woman I met, up in New Hampshire, some years ago.   
I was up there, delivering pegs, late, couldn't get a whole lot later than arriving the morning of the raising. But some times it seemed like I sure tried, pushin that envelope. 

Anyway, Someone grabbed them pegs, rushed them off, all smilin and laughin, handing them to some other folks, who rushed them off to still others, and somehow they got into the hands of those who needed them, right quick too. 

For me, I was shuffled off to the kitchen, where hot, black, coffee steamed, keeping company with yards of food waiting for someone to come along and say; "Hey! This here's a feast, and, by Gosh, I'm hungry, willing and able." well, I found myself to be all three and sure enough, it wasn't long before I was elbow to elbow with others of like mind.

One of my companions, on that sunlight, crisp morning, in the shadow of Mt. Washington, had the most incredible story I had ever heard, about becoming an apprentice in this business. As time went on, and her tale unfolded, I soon realized that she just Didn't have a clue as to what she had managed to accomplish.

It seemed that she tried everywhere, and just couldn't get hired, no matter what she did, or who she approached, in the end she concluded that there was just no way it was going to happen, 

Cause she was a Woman.

But she wasn't ready to give up that easy, this bug, this Timber Framing dream she was infected with, just wouldn't let go, wouldn't get out of her system, and, by gosh, one way or another she was going to learn the trade.

Somehow she got it into her head that, the only way it was going to happen was... If she got her **Own** jobs, then hired her own crew. This way they'd have no choice, they'd be forced to teach her, cause she'd be the Boss.

Well, isn't that just what she did. Somehow, this young person, who'd never sold a job before, heck, she'd never even worked on one, who didn't know her ass from her elbow when it came to heavy timbers, and, when asked how many houses she'd built, of **Any** kind, had to answer; "Including this one?"

But, she did it, sold a job, hired a crew, and Gosh, didn't she learn her trade. But, boy, wasn't she mad. Here she was, walkin alongside, me, scuffing the bare earth for all she was worth. Not looking up, not looking left, not looking right, but focused Right There, down at her feet. She was lost in this story she was telling, the emotions of it coming over her, Heck Mt. Washington iteslf, could have blown it's top, Grizzly bears covered in ivy and ridden by leprachauns could've danced on by us, accompanied by a flotilla of Faire Folk, showering Gold on the unfortunates and she wouldn't been none the wiser, so deep was she. 

For me, I was grinning like an idiot, and let me tell you, that's something I do well. Here I was, coffee in hand, walking alongside the Ninth Wonder of the World, and the one responsible for it, the one that Made this little wonder happened, was just blinder than the proverbial bat, to it all, heck, not only that, but she felt cheated! 

At one point she did look up, to shake her fist, grit her teeth and darn near shout loud enough to bring the snow, and ice, down on all of us, that Men had it so damn easy, all because they had a piece of meat swinging between their legs.

Well, I can't say as to that. what I can say is, that until she started listening to other folks stories, stories of how they got to where **She** was, Right now, then it seems as though her giving herself the credit she was so rightly deserving of, was going to be a long time in coming.

Me, it was years before I sold my first job, and, when I did, I sure as heck didn't have enough cash to hire Anyone who knew the least little bit about what they were doing, well, point is, there just isn't that much left over when you charge three grand for a frame, Raising and Lumber included, no matter How small it was.

Not only that, but, you mihgt think you are the Boss, cause you're holding the purse strings, and you've got the ear of the Client, but, think again, especially in this business. It's been said, mostly by those in the trade, that Timber Framers are a bunch of, Gosh Darn, primadonna's, I'd say that ain't far from the mark. 

But it's not all bad. Thing is, she might have been paying these folks, heck, she might have hand-picked them, found the job, leveled the site by hand, even, and it just wouldn't matter. That guy who had the skill, it's His name on the job, not hers. He's the expert, and he says what gets cut, and what doesn't, and when all that's going to happen. 

See, if he cuts the frame, and that design is fucked, well, so is he, it's his ass in the sling on this one, more so than it's hers. But she says everything went well, and, by gosh, that told me one of two things, maybe three;
* That this guy was a no-good alcholic bum, who was just the next thing from drawing up a sign which read; "Will work for food", when she pulled up, and, boy, you just don't look a gift horse in the mouth
Or;
* Things went well, sure enough, and anytime anything important needed to be done he'd tell her how it was the "Boss" who needed to fetch the coffee, cause, don't you know, if that brew ain't just right the whole job was libel to fall apart, and, darn, if he hadn't seen it happen, May his Pappy Rest In Peace.

But my bet was
* That this person had some skill, and boy, there isn't anything sweeter, in this business, tha having someone with gosh darn talent, true grit, and honest to goodness Motivation. working for you. And, Heck, if getting your own job just so you can learn isn't motivation, then, I sure as heck don't know what would be. I thought I had motivation, and true grit, but this here person was putting me to shame.

So, this section is mostly about people's stories, how they got started, what kept them going, and, what obstacles they had to overcome.   
Some might not be as dramatic as this young woman's, but, the point is that everyone **Has** a story, and, if you look, and listen, it won't take you long to find someone who's been in **Your** shoes. And, isn't that all we need, to see, that we're not alone?

* [Peter McCurdy](/http-www-mccurdyco-com-page3-html) & Co. Though one of their most prominent jobs was the Replication of Shakespeare's Globe theater in York, England, it is just one of a long line of Awe-Inspiring projects.


**interconnectedness**. A number of years ago Peter and Co. was hired to do an extensive survey, of Harmondsworth Barn in England -- A Tithing barn, very long. That data was then used by Richard Lawson (Dovetail Woodworking at the time) to produce a replica of it in Conn. USA, a replica that was approxiamately half as long, or less. At the end of the project, Paul Martin was called in, as a consultant to help finish out the Hipped roof on one end of the structure. paul and Richard were later to form a team, along with Tom Haris, Richard's son, Jack Sobon (as an Architectural Consultant), adn at least one other who currently slips my mind. This team competed for, and won, the bid to rebuild the Timber Framed Roof of the Cabildo in New Orleans after a fire had devastated the original. Fredric Brillant was recruited to provide the absolutely essential expertise in Traditional French Scribe, the layout system which was used to construct the Historic Roof System.

 **The** world of Traditional timber framing is a relatively small one. The point of this example is more than merely name dropping. Peter and Fredric represent two poles. Both practice methods of scribe rule, as opposed to all of the others mentioned above, who -- at that time -- practice Square Rule, which is an Americam system dating back to about 1805, or so. Unlike scribe rule, square rule allows every piece of a frame to be layn out and cut, independently of the others. It is centered around the idea of a theoretical timber existing within the Real, and, may or may not -- depending on the manner of conversion, and the local differences -- have any actual contact with, or relation to, the Actual timber. 

**The** concept of Real vs. Theoretical timber will also play a large role in the discussion on Hewing.
* [Len Brackett](/http-www-eastwindinc-com-index-html) Is a very impressive Builder in a Traditional Japanese Style. His personal story is both interesting and inspiring, as is the work he and his company have produced. If you have an interest in the techniques and forms of Japan, this is a good place to start. He also practices a manner of scribe rule, one that is different from the English, or, the French system. He would be the third pole.
* [Paul Martin](/http-www-vtf-com-paul-profile-html), once considered to be one of the best of the European Style Timber Framers, second to the likes of Frederic Brillant. It's unlikely that this has changed. After completeing the Cabildo Paul began practicing a method of layout which seemed to incorporated elements of both Square Rule and French Scribe.
* [Ted Benson](/http-www-bensonwood-com) Though not a Traditionalist, no discussion of timber framing, near past, present, or future, would be complete without including Ted. Ted was the Voice of the "Modernist" framer. As one of my early Bosses, a Bensonite himself, stated;

"When I read Ted's book, I said, yes. This guys doing just what I'm doing. I must be doing something right."

Ted though, does not live in a vaccuum. As any discusson of Modern Timber framing cannot be considered complete without his inclusion, no discussion of Ted can be complete without mention of;

* [Ben Brungraber](/http-www-smithsonianmag-si-edu-smithsonian-issues02-apr02-images-timber-ben-brungraber-jpg-html). Ben has been, and still is a dynamic element of the Bensonwood team. Famous in the community for his "Stress Tests" as well as his humor, insights, and tremendous energy. A debate with Ben, no matter what side of the issue you find yourself on, is as delightful as it is challenging. I have nothing but respect for this man.



* [Ken Rower](/http-www-tfguild-org-pubpg-html) the long time editor of "Timber Framing" the Journal of the [Timber Framers Guild of North America](/http-www-tfguild-org-index-html), has been something of the Man Behind The Scenes, these many years. Timberframing has always delivered strong, well articulated voices from every Faction, minor and major. Under Ken's hand Timberframing has been a source of controversy and challenge, both of which are vital elements of growth.
