# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:Chapter Thumbnails

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

This is inspired & motivated by 
[Chapter Thumbnails for Infinite Jest](/http-members-aol-com-russillosm-ij-html). "Knowing the jist of each chapter, I found, makes it easy to hop around and reread relevant passages; these notes were, for me, VERY helpful in keeping track..."

Here are the notes I took when reading it. I took page numbers from my first edition US hardback, though the page numbers appear to match the trade paperback, which even has the same typos. 

I felt that listing all the character appearances was helpful, but that having a simpler version might be a better default. I moved the full list, with character appearances, to  [Quicksilver: Chapter Thumbnails with Character Appearances](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-chapter-thumbnails-with-character-appearances). Feel free to discuss if you have a preference.
