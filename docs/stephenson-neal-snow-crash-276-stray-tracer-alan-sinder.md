 *White phosphorus is used in military incendiaries, smoke pots, smoke bombs and tracer bullets. Phosphorus may no longer be used in tracer ammo - but tracer ammo caused changes in one of Neal Stephenson's characters  Mr. Ng from Snow Crash who informs [YT](/stephenson-neal-snow-crash-yt)**: My helicopter caught fire during the evacuation of Saigon in 1974  a stray tracer from ground forces.***

### Tracer ammunition


From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. 

**Tracer** [bullets](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-bullet) have a hollow back, filled with a [pyrotechnic](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-pyrotechnic) flare material. Usually this is a mixture of [magnesium](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-magnesium), [perchlorate](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-ammonium-perchlorate), and [chromium](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-chromium), to yield a bright red color. Tracers allow the shooter to get a good idea where most of the bullets are going, without actually having to look through a sighting apparatus.

Tracers were used extensively in [machine guns](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-machine-gun) in [World War I](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-world-war-i), and usually loaded every 4 rounds in ground guns, and every 2 or 3 rounds in aircraft guns. 

Tracers were used extensively in [World War II](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-world-war-ii) and the [Vietnam war](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-vietnam-war) (by the Vietnamese). Tracers are used by the U.S. marines in nightfire situations. 

A disadvantage of tracers is that they show the enemy the location of the shooter. As an old military proverb puts it, tracers work both ways .

Early tracer rounds often had different [aerodynamics](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-aerodynamics) and even weight from ordinary rounds, so that over long ranges the stream of tracer rounds and the stream of ordinary rounds could diverge. This is less of a problem with modern tracer rounds.
