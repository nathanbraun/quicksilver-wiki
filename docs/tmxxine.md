How often do we travel to other dimensions? Or [places of the imagination](/http-tmxxine-bloki-com)? 

Fond memories and favoured childhood rainbow creations. These imagined places are as real as Sanity Clause is to our child. Everyone knows that. Some cultures feel our realm is the dream time and the dream world is more real.

**Thus is how ye shall see all this fleeting world. A star at dawn, a bubble in a stream, a flash of lightning in a summer cloud, a flickering lamp, a phantom, and a dream.** 
*the Diamond Sutra*

**Those who know the reality of the world, know it well that the world is nothing but a mirage** 
*Gisu Daraz*

Quantum physics is preparing to slip not just through time but reality itself. The OSS Tmxxine project created by a group of 'holygeeks', rogue [alchemists](/http-www-cyber-shaktipat-org-relax), freelance hackers and open source extremists has plans so radical that even the Dalia Lama is producing an extra chuckle.

**What is Tmxxine?** 
Tmxxine is for time travelers and travelers to other dimensions. 

**How soon will I be able to book my future holiday?**
It will take time. First we have to transmit data from the present time to the future. 

**Will I be able to phone 'next year'?**
Maybe in the future, next year will be available yesterday. 

**Is that weird?** 
At the present time it is difficult to conceive 

**How do we build a time machine?** 
We need 
the ability to bend, 
concentrate 
and accelerate very small things 
called quanta 

**What is a brane?** 
A brane is short for membrane. Each dimension is called a brane.

The Ozmonaughts (travelers to other realms) have created a chat room called [CurlChat](/http-www-zen45800-zen-co-uk-curlchat) for communication both in this realm and to others. The computer hacking model of reverse engineering has enabled the Tmxxine team to prepare for a voluntary code of conduct reminiscent of the first directive from Start Trek to be ratified by the Chronology Protection Agency. A set of agreements, 'the IDA', for trade and diplomacy between dimensions is being developed.

Just google the word tmxxine and a new inner world emerges. A variety of websites that blends innovative computing languages, dervish ideas of drifting, shamanic cage jumping and cutting edge Quantum theory. 

Using a computer hacking model of reverse engineering the Tmxxine team came to the conclusion that:

* Movement between time and branes - different dimensional mem(branes) - is on the verge of scientific breakthrough.
* It is possible to alter chronon time entanglements (small 'packets of quantum time') at the macro level
* Only an open and free society can be responsible for the technology which offers limitless strategic advantage to old world order politicians


Tmxxine has proposed a voluntary code of conduct reminiscent of the first directive from Start Trek to be ratified by the Chronology Protection Agency and a set of agreements, 'the IDA', for trade and diplomacy between dimensions:

**Tmxxine Prime Directive**

* The right of each sentient to live in accordance within its normal cultural evolution and continuum is considered inviolate.
* No Chronology Protection Agents may interfere with the development of alternative time and brane continuums. Such interference includes the introduction of superior knowledge or technology to a realm whose environment is incapable of handling such interaction.
* CPA personnel may not violate this Prime Directive, even to save their sanity unless they are acting to right an earlier violation or an accidental contamination. This directive takes precedence over any and all other considerations, and carries with it the highest moral obligation.


Tmxxine concludes that the software to control hardware must be open source and decided to start writing it; relying on the hardware being created as an afterthought or the future result of their early efforts.

Using the lateral thinking made famous by Edward de Bono tmxxine was bringing reverse engineering to the quantum level. Always moving beyond and to the side, allows them to come up with solutions before the arising of problems. 

 Tmxxine have made some remarkable predictions (which they consider history). Some forecasts; the demise of the movable storage, the rise of open source software, the rapid adoption of speech recognition and translation are easy enough. 

**Others are a little more off-stream**

* The emergence of a winX operating system that combines the best of propriety and open souce systems.
* Quantum storage devices. Devices that store all information from the Internet in an infinity grid.
* The rise of the search engines â€“ the manipulation of data as the new area of focus for commercial IT technology.

 **Introduction to Tmxxine**

 Tmxxine hardware and software project, is a diverse, public domain exploration of alternative time continuum's and dimensions. Multidisciplinary; encouraging philosophers, net browsers, technologists, artists, programmers and scientists. Tmxxine is open and multidimensional through intent, structure and goal. 

**What is the goal?**

 We are working towards software and generating an understanding of the potential hardware. Side projects will enable and develop the skills of active participants.

[![Tmxxine Church Lecture](/web/20060725221808im_/http://www.metaweb.com/wiki/upload/d/df/Church.jpg)](tmxxine-church-lecture)

**What is the history of the Project?**

*N.B. It has always been our intention to close down hell and set up a communication with heaven. Church funding is not available in this time continuum.*

 The first creation was Tmxxine HolyGeek e-mail forum to develop secure and reliable computing resources and skills whilst introducing some of the ideas of Quantum Physics. At this time the project was largely introductory in nature. Early efforts concentrated on skills development, developing workable design paradigms, information gathering, concept familiarisation, skill interdependence and mutual actualization

 The need for a hardware model established Tmxxine ProjeX e-mail forum which introduced the Tmxxine Laxmi Foundation as a practical means towards funding support. 

**What has been achieved so far?**

 Prototype Consoles have been created in NetLogo which outputs java. A communication prototype, CurlChat, used for regular net meetings, has been created in the Curl Language. XBasic is being used for a prototype expected for release in 2008CE Extensive support for a secure OS has created the continuining emergence of DVD recordable OS Puppy Linux. We are now moving into [wikis](/http-peace-wikicities-com-wiki-november) and web based prograamming and resources.

travel has been a staple of science fiction. With the advent of general
relativity it has been entertained by serious physicists. But, especially
in the philosophy literature, there have been arguments that time travel
is inherently paradoxical. The most famous paradox is the grandfather
paradox: you travel back in time and kill your grandfather, thereby
preventing your own existence. To avoid inconsistency some circumstance
will have to occur which makes you fail in this attempt to kill your
grandfather. Doesn\u2019t this require some implausible constraint on
otherwise unrelated circumstances? We examine such worries in the context
of modern physics. |

Raymond Laflamme, of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, has

start out uniform, go through a cycle of expansion and collapse, and end
up in a uniform state. It could start out disordered, expand, and then
collapse back into disorder. But, since the COBE data show that our
Universe was born in a smooth and uniform state, this symmetric
possibility cannot be applied to the real Universe. |

Science says time travel is theoretically possible. And some people say
they've already done it, or invented machines that make it a reality.

It's the 21st century! Time to feed your

Basics

So what is string theory? For that matter, what the heck are elementary
particles? If this all sounds totally confusing, try this section first.


Experiment

What progress are physicists making towards experimental tests of string
theory predictions? Mathematics

What kinds of math do string theorists use and why? And how has string
theory changed mathematics? 

Black Holes


Personal safety issues aside, when black holes are tied up in strings,
they get even more interesting. Cosmology

Was there a String Bang before the Big Bang, or did the Universe simply
unwind?  |
