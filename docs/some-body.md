# Metaweb:Some body

(Redirected from [Some body](/some-body))

Every action by a [Metaweb:contributor](/metaweb-contributor) must be assumed to have **some body** behind it. If it is a [bot](/metaweb-bot) (robot) or [shill](/metaweb-shill) (paid, probably by a [corporation](/corporation) or [military](/military)), it may have [Metaweb:no body](/metaweb-no-body) behind it. Policies for "no body" must differ from those for "some body" - we owe bodies things we don't owe bots:

* respect for [human rights](/human-rights)
* respect for [free speech](/free-speech)
* respect for [privacy](/privacy)
* some [empathy](/empathy)


It is also possible that the body spoken for may not be the body that is typing or reading comments. For instance, someone assisting a quadriplegic might type in their comments, or, a teacher of [ape language](/ape-language) might put in comments by a gorilla received in sign language, or, a group of children might be represented by a common account managed by a teacher. In these cases there is still **some body** behind the account, and the same considerations apply. However it might be wise to ask such proxies to state which bodies they are acting for.

Political or religious representatives might come to the metaweb to express views of those that they lead or protect. This opens the question of whether they represent **some body** or merely [some ideology](/metaweb-ideology), with no body. Probably only a [faction](/metaweb-faction) system can really address this, as it does in the real world.
