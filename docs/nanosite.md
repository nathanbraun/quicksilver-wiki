Nanosites are infinitesimal devices whose main territory is the human body. The name derives from "Nanotechnological Parasite". Occurences in the novel:

* [Bud](/bud) had a set of Nanosites embedded in his muscles, for the purpose of electrical stimulation. This allowed him to work out constantly, without the need to visit a gym.


* [Miranda](/miranda) and other [ractors](/ractor) have a [racting grid](/racting-grid) implanted in their skin. This grid of nanosites covers a ractor's entire body and varies in density, from only a few on the top of the head to massive amounts in the face, particulary around the lips and eyes where emoting is more noticable. The grid acts as a motion-capture system, relaying the ractor's motion to the media network.


* The [drummers](/drummers) rely on a nanosite, spread by the transmission of body fluid, to maintain their gestalt society.


* Nanosites can also take the form of weaponry. Rebels led by Zhang used an infestation to kill roughly fifteen thousand men in a single night. Constable Moore was also injured by a similar, but primitive variety. It's safe to assume that his body's immune system fought it off, but left him scarred.


* Medicinal nanosites can be used to help heal wounds, kill pain, and treat disease, presumably by performing surgery on a nanoscopic level.


* [Judge Fang](/judge-fang) uses specialised nanosites when torturing suspects for information. These can send false pain messages along nerves, torturing someone while not leaving a single mark.
