Is he gone?

* No, he has just been sitting quietly on the sidelines watching events unfold. He will make a contribution when he decides he has one as sterling as the rest that have been made. And to whoever, er, culled together a "bio" for him... he says thank you... (Thanks Stsparky).

By the far the two best stories in this collection are Terry Bisson's "Bears Discover Fire" and Pat Murphy's powerful and eloquently written "In the Abode of Snows." After that, the other stories didn't seem to stir me quite as much .They were well written yes, but still... The extensive reading list at the end of the book is especially helpful to those interested in the ideas behind the variuos themes in the story. For that and the 2 stories, i gave it the above score.

Good to see you here. I always figure [Chris Moore](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-christopher-moore) pegged Anubis right in his ***Coyote Blue*** ... - [Sparky](/user-stsparky) 19:53, 2004 Apr 21 (PDT)

I looked up ***Coyote Blue***, and it looks quite interesting. Our school lib doesn't carry any of Moore's books so it'll be awhile before I get a chance to read his stuff. Thanks for putting me onto it though. [Njihia Mbitiru](/njihia-mbitiru)
