# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:5:...the preacher's rantings... (Alan Sinder)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

I'm going to go out on a limb and attempt to identify the unknown preacher as [Cotton Mather](/cotton-mather). He ties into both witches and pirates nicely.

Like the local Wait-Still Waterhouse, he went to Harvard.
