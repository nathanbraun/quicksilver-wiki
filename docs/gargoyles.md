### Stephensonia


 *Hiro says to YT in the Metaverse:
     "Remember when you gave me shit about spending all my money on computer stuff?"  

     "Yeah."  

     "I decided I wasn't spending enough. So I got a beltpack machine. Smallest ever made. I'm walking down the street with this thing strapped to my belly. It's really cool."  

     "You're a gargoyle."  

     "Yeah, but its not like having all this clunky shit strapped all over your body--"  

     "You're a gargoyle..."*

### Description


A **gargoyle** is a person who walks around with [wearable computer](/) equipment on, documenting and mediating reality via heads up displays, retinal scanners, video/audio recorders, and wireless links to network resources. Looking somewhat like [Borganisms](/), they tend to freak out unaugmented people, and their behavior in [mediated reality](/mediated-reality) does not seem to assist in their sociability with people exclusively 'real'.

Gargoyles particularly behave as they do to spam intelligence databases with information in a 'shotgun' or 'firehose' strategy, hoping that paying customers will find some of the information worth paying for. Gargoyles, having a very low signal to noise ratio, are disliked by intelligence database corporations like [Central Intelligence Corporation](/central-intelligence-corporation) and tend not to last very long with such companies. [Dr. Emanuel Lagos](/dr-emanuel-lagos) is one exception to this rule, possibly because he had made a career in the Library of Congress before it and the CIA were spun off from the US government into a private start-up company.

### Historical Roots



> "No symbolism can explain the monstrous fauna of the cathedrals... 
> If ever works are exempt of meaning surely these are... 
> All attempts at explanation must be foredoomed to failure." 
> E. Male, \_L'art religieux du XIIIe siecle en France\_ 8th edition



Quoting from "Sturgis' *Illustrated Dictionary of Architecture and Building*":

"The word *"Gargoyle"* shares a common root with the word *"Gargle"*; which comes from *"gargouille"*, a French word for *"Throat"*. A true gargoyle is a waterspout. The word *gargoyle* is also a derivative from the Latin word, *gurgulio*, which had a double meaning, *throat*, and the *gurgling* sound water makes as it passes through a gargoyle." 


While this is meant to describe specifically carved creatures that spout water, the word usage in [Snow Crash](/snow-crash) is apt in that a [CIC](/cic) [stringer](/http-www-hyperdictionary-com-search-aspx-define-freelance) who is a **gargoyle** acts as a waterspout of information who does not attempt, usually, to filter out noise or extraneous data from the binary flow. Because of this they are seen as ugly by the [Central Intelligence Corporation](/central-intelligence-corporation) from a quality of work point of view as well as ugly physically by those they encounter due to their bulky borg-like wearables.

Sturgis goes on to say:  

"A carved creature that does not serve the purpose of a drain pipe is frequently referred to as a "Grotesque". Legend has it, that a fierce dragon named *La Gargouille* described as having a long, reptilian neck, a slender snout and membranous wings lived in a cave near the river Seine. The dragon caused much fear and destruction with its fiery breath, spouting water and the devouring of ships and men. Each year, the residents of Rouen would placate Gargouille with an offering of a victim, usually a criminal, though it was said the dragon preferred maidens. Around 600 CE, the village was saved by St. Romanis, who promised to deal with the dragon if the townspeople agreed to be baptized and to build a church. Romanus subdued the dragon by making the sign of the cross and then led the now docile beast back to town on a leash made from his priest's robe. La Gargouille was then burned at the stake, it is said that his head and neck were so well tempered by the heat of his fiery breath, that they would not burn. These remnants were then mounted on the town wall and became the model for gargoyles for centuries to come."



### Plot Analysis


With respect to the story at hand, it is clear that Hiro, after becoming a Gargoyle himself and travelling to [The Raft](/the-raft), "caused fear and destruction" with the fiery breath of [Reason](/reason) (note also that Dragons are legendary for being as wise as they are violent), devouring ships and men in his path to rescue [YT](/yt), [Juanita Marquez](/juanita-marquez), and the [Nam-Shub of Enki](/stephenson-neal-snow-crash-506-the-nam-shub-of-enki-alan-sinder), after spouting a significant amount of intelligence at [Ng](/ng-security-industries-inc), [Uncle Enzo](/uncle-enzo), and [Mr Lee](/mr-lee-s-greater-hong-kong) which earns him the treasure of $25 million [kong bucks](/dollar).

[Hiro Protagonist](/hiro-protagonist) feels a bit monstrous long before donning a wearable PC. Being ethnically african-american-korean, and a military brat, he feels chronically out-of-place wherever he goes in life, which is the major factor in his inability to understand himself that is such a turn-off for Juanita, according to YT, and a hindrance to holding a steady career trajectory. This is why he is a [CIC](/cic) stringer and non-profit rock band promoter living in a [storage unit](/u-stor-it) despite being a super-hacker and [the world's greatest swordsman](/the-world-s-greatest-swordsman).

This is specifically distinguished when Hiro is confronted in a [Snooze n' Cruise](/snooze-n-cruise) [franchulate](/franchulate) bar by a group of rednecked racists from the [New South Africa](/new-south-africa) [FOQNE](/foqne) down the road. They apparently were wondering if Hiro was a "lazy shiftless watermelon-eating black-ass nigger, or a sneaky little v.d. infested gook" as a prelude to beating the crap out of him. His response, of beheading the lead racist with his katana, is classically monstrous and turns the victim into his own sort of bloody gargoyle.

The interesting inversion of this story is that the Hero/Hiro is the gargoyle, the monster, vanquishing the King of all Media, [L Bob Rife](/l-bob-rife), from his watery keep, and rescuing the virgin (YT, though not so much anymore) and the goddess ([Juanita Marquez](/juanita-marquez)/[Innanna](/)). In this respect, he plays a bit of an anti-hero role compared to classical fairy tales, such that he is only heroic in that he is far better than the real bad guys, L Bob, and his minion, [Raven](/raven). He is therefore somewhat like [Grendel](/).

[Lagos](/dr-emanuel-lagos), on the other hand, who is the other gargoyle in the story, falls under the knife of Raven because he focused too much on the job of gargoyling, and was thus consumed in the role, losing his soul to the Raven.


Lagos *might* still be in the game if he had:

#### [Invisibile Raincoats](/)


**[Optical camouflage](/http-projects-star-t-u-tokyo-ac-jp-projects-media-xv-oc-html)** is a kind of active camouflage in which one wears a fabric which projects an image of the scene directly behind the wearer, so that the wearer appears invisible. The concept exists for now only in theory and in proof-of-concept prototypes, although many experts consider it technically feasible. It is an example of active camouflage (or adaptive camouflage).

The idea appears in many fictional works, such as the William Gibson novel Neuromancer, where it is referred to as a "polychromatic suit," but achieved recognition in the successful sci-fi manga (and later anime) Ghost in the Shell. It has been also featured in the 2002 James Bond movie Die Another Day, as well as a similar technology appearing in the Metal Gear Solid video game series as well as the latest installment of the Splinter Cell series, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory.

In 2003, three professors at University of Tokyo  Susumu Tachi, Masahiko Inami and Naoki Kawakami  created a prototypical camouflage system in which a video camera takes a shot of the background and displays it on the cloth using an external projector. The same year Time magazine named it the coolest invention of 2003. [[1]](/http-www-time-com-time-2003-inventions-invinvisible-html)
While optical camouflage may not yet exist, it is worthwhile to point out that certain military units like the F-117 nighthawk Stealth Fighter and B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber do use material that make them difficult, if not impossible, to spot on RADAR.

![Himeji_Castle_gargoyle.jpg](/https://web.archive.org/web/20060725165628im_/http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/da/Himeji_Castle_gargoyle.jpg)  
A [Japanese](/) gargoyle adorning [Himeji Castle](/)
In [architecture](/), **gargoyles**, or gurgoyles (from the [French language|French](/) *gargouille,* originally the throat or gullet, cf. [Latin](/) *gurgulio, gula,* and similar words derived from root *gar,* to swallow, the word representing the gurgling sound of water; Ital. *doccione;* Ger. *Ausguss*), are the carved terminations to a spout which conveys water away from the [gutters](/).

Gargoyles are mostly [grotesque](/) figures. A local legend that sprang up around the name of St. Romanus ("Romain") ([631](/) – [641](/) A.D.), the former chancellor of the Merovingian king [Clotaire II](/) who was made bishop of [Rouen](/), relates how he delivered the country around [Rouen](/) from a monster called *Gargouille*, having had the creature captured by a liberated prisoner. In commemoration of St. Romain the Archbishops of Rouen were granted the right to set a prisoner free on the day that the [reliquary](/) of the saint was carried in procession (see details at [Rouen](/).). 

The term *gargoyle* is applied most often to [medieval](/) work, but throughout all ages some means of throwing the water off roofs, when not conveyed in gutters, was adopted. In [Egypt](/) gargoyles eject the water used in the washing of the sacred vessels which seems to have been done on the flat roofs of the [temples](/). In [Greek temples](/), the water from roofs passed through the mouths of lions whose heads were carved or modelled in the [marble sculpture|marble](/) or [terra cotta](/) [cymatium](/) of the [cornice (architecture)|cornice](/). At [Pompeii](/) many terra cotta gargoyles were found that are modelled in the shape of animals.

Gargoyles, or more precisely [chimera (creature)|chimerae](/), were used as decoration on [19th century|19th](/) and early [20th century](/) buildings in cities such as [New York City|New York](/) (where the [Chrysler Building](/)'s aluminum gargoyles are celebrated), and [Chicago, Illinois|Chicago](/).

Statues representing gargoyle-like creatures are popular sales items, particularly in [goth](/) and [New Age](/) [retail](/) stores. Gargoyles as a distinct [race](/) have featured in several works of [fantasy fiction](/), such as [Terry Pratchett](/)'s [Discworld](/) series and the *[Dungeons & Dragons](/)* [role-playing game](/). They were also prominently featured in a [Disney](/) [animated series](/), *[Gargoyles](/)*, and played a role in that company's adaptation of [Victor Hugo](/)'s *[The Hunchback of Notre Dame](/)*. Actress [Adrienne Barbeau](/) played a violent gargoyle in the TV series *Monsters*. Gargoyles are also mentioned many times in the [Harry Potter](/) series.

### [Gargoyles (animated series)](/)


**Gargoyles** is an acclaimed Walt Disney superhero animated series that aired from October 24, 1994 to 1997 featuring a clan of six warrior creatures that were turned to stone during the day. Led by the gargoyle Goliath in the year 994, they protected Castle Wyvern and its resident humans on the coast of Scotland until betrayal allowed a Viking massacre to destroy almost all of their clan and a magic spell forced them to sleep in their stone forms for a millennium until the castle could rise above the clouds.
In 1994, a billonaire named David Xanatos purchased the castle and had it moved to the top of his skyscraper to fulfill the conditions of the spell. Waking up in modern day Manhattan, the gargoyles must adapt to this new world as they protect the citizens of New York (most of whom don't even believe they exist) and face both new and old enemies with the help of their new human friend (and possible love interest for Goliath), NYPD detective Elisa Maza.

**A screen shot from the Gargoyles television series.  
Should be fair use.**
Gargoyles in medieval Scotland didn't have names, as it wasn't their custom. Goliath only had one because it was given to him by Prince Malcolm. In the modern world they find that having names would make things easier for their humans friends (particularly Elisa), so the five choose names from New York landmarks.

The series was known for its very complex story arcs and drama. A major example is the episode, "Deadly Force" which dealt with gun violence when Broadway accidentally shoots and seriously wounds Elisa when he was playing with her gun. After delivering her to a hospital, the real dramatic focus is on Broadway's coming to grips with his responsibility in the accident. Character arcs are also heavily employed through the series with such examples being Brooklyn's coming of age and Xanatos' conflict with the Gargoyles and its resolution.

A remarkably large number of voice actors for the show had been actors on various Star Trek series. ...(complete in [link](/)).

### Wikipedia: Wearable Computing


A **wearable computer** is a small [portable computer](/portable-computer) that is designed to be worn on the body during use. In this wearable computers differ from [PDAs](/personal-digital-assistant), which are designed for hand-held use, although the distinction can sometimes be a blurry one. Wearable computers are usually either integrated into the user's [clothing](/clothing) or can be attached to the body through some other means, like a wristband. They may also be integrated into everyday objects that are constantly worn on the body, like a [wrist](/wrist) [watch](/watch) or a hands-free [cell phone](/cell-phone).

Wearable computing is an active topic of [research](/research), with areas of study including [user interface](/user-interface) design, [augmented reality](/augmented-reality), [pattern recognition](/pattern-recognition), use of wearables for specific applications or disabilities, electronic textiles and fashion design. Many issues are common to the wearables, [mobile computing](/mobile-computing) and [ubiquitous computing](/ubiquitous-computing) research [communities](/scientific-community), including power management and heat dissipation, software architectures, [wireless](/wireless) and [personal area networks](/personal-area-network) and [sensor networks](/sensor-network).

Wearable computers are especially useful for applications that require computational support while the user's hands, voice, eyes or attention are activly engaged with the physical environment. Such applications include presentation of information to mechanics, military or paramilitary personnel, pathfinding for the blind, realtime translation from one spoken language to another, and continuous medical monitoring. Because of this focus on minimal impact, the largest differences between wearable and other mobile computing platforms are the human-computer interface. Depending on the application, the primary input to a wearable might be a chording keyboard, [gesture](/gesture-recongnition), [speech recognition](/speech-recognition) or even just passive sensors ([context awareness](/context-awareness)). Output might be presented via speech, audio tones, a [head-mounted display](/head-mounted-display) or [haptic](/haptic) output. Output can also be combined with the physical world through a visual or audio [augmented reality](/augmented-reality) interface.

The commercialization of general-purpose wearable computers, as led by companies such as [Xybernaut](/xybernaut), CDI and ViA Inc, has thus far met with limited success. Publicly-traded Xybernaut has forged alliances with companies such as [IBM](/ibm) and [Sony](/sony) in order to make wearable computing widely available, but is now facing financial difficulties. In 1998 [Seiko](/seiko) marketed the [Ruputer](/ruputer), a computer in a (fairly large) wristwatch, to mediocre returns. In 2001 [IBM](/ibm) developed and publicly displayed two prototypes for a wristwatch computer running Linux, but the product never came to market. In 2002 [Fossil](/fossil) announced the Fossil WristPDA, which ran the [PalmOS](/palmos). Its release date was set for summer of 2003, but was delayed several times and was finally made available on January 5, 2005.

Wearable computing devices have fared far better when designed and sold for a particular application. The two most ubiquitous examples would be portable MP3 players and cell phones (especially cell phones with wireless microphone attachments). Such devices look far different from the traditional **cyborg** image of wearable computers, but in fact these devices are becoming more powerful and more wearable all the time.


[![thumb|230px|left|Evolution of Steve Mann's <em>WearComp</em> wearable computer from backpack based systems of the late 1970s and early 1980s to his current covert systems.](/web/20060725165628im_/http://www.metaweb.com/wiki/upload/e/eb/230px-Wearcompevolution.jpg)](thumb-230px-left-evolution-of-steve-mann-s-em-wearcomp-em-wearable-computer-from-backpack-based-systems-of-the-late-1970s-and-early-1980s-to-his-current-covert-systems)  
Evolution of [Steve Mann](/)'s *WearComp*  
wearable computer from backpack based  
systems of the late 1970s  
and early 1980s to his  
current covert systems.

Depending on how broadly one defines both *wearable* and *computer*, the first wearable computer could be as early as the [1500s](/1500s) with the invention of the [pocket watch](/pocket-watch) or even the [1200s](/1200s) with the invention of [eyeglasses](/eyeglasses). The first device that would fit the modern-day image of a wearable computer was constructed in [1961](/1961) by the [mathematician](/mathematician) [Edward O. Thorp](/edward-o-thorp), better known as the inventer of the theory of card-counting for [blackjack](/blackjack), and [Claude E. Shannon](/claude-e-shannon), who is best known as "the father of [information theory](/information-theory)." The system was a concealed cigarette-pack sized analog computer designed to predict [roulette](/roulette) wheels. A data-taker would use microswitches hidden in his shoes to indicate the speed of the roulette wheel, and the computer would indicate an octant to bet on by sending musical tones via radio to a miniature speaker hidden in a collaborators ear canal. The system was successfully tested in Las Vegas in June [1961](/1961), but hardware issues with the speaker wires prevented them from using it beyond their test runs. Their wearable was kept secret until it was was first mentioned in Thorp's book *Beat the Dealer* (revised ed.) in 1966 and later published in detail in 1969. The 1970s saw rise to similar roulette-prediction wearable computers using next-generation technology, in particular a group known as *Eudaemonic Enterprises* that used a CMOS [6502](/6502) microprocessor with 5K RAM to create a shoe-computer with inductive radio communications between a data-taker and better (Bass 1985).

Besides gambling aids, early wearable applications included two notable systems designed to help the disabled. In [1967](/1967), Hubert Upton developed an analogue wearable computer that included an eyeglass-mounted display to aid [lip reading](/lip-reading). Using high and low-pass filters, the system would determine if a spoken [phoneme](/phoneme) was a [fricative](/fricative), [stop consonant](/stop-consonant), voiced-[fricative](/fricative), voiced [stop consanant](/stop-consanant), or simply [voiced](/voiced). An [LED](/led) mounted on ordinary eyeglasses illuminated to indicate the phoneme type. The LEDs were positioned to enable a simple form of [augmented reality](/augmented-reality); for example, when a phoneme was voiced the LED at the bottom of the glass illuminated, making it seem as if the speaker's throat was glowing (Upton 1968). Another early wearable system was a camera-to-tactile vest for the blind, published by C.C. Collins in [1977](/1977), that converted images into a 1024-point, 10-inch square tactile grid on a vest (Collins 1977). On the consumer end, [1977](/1977) also saw the
introduction of the HP-01 algebraic calculator watch by [Hewlett-Packard](/hewlett-packard) (Marion 1977).

The 1980s saw the rise of more general-purpose wearable computers. In [1981](/1981) [Steve Mann](/steve-mann) designed and built a backpack-mounted [6502](/6502)-based computer to control flash-bulbs, cameras and other photographic systems. The display was a camera viewfinder CRT attached to a helmet, giving 40-column text. Input was from seven microswitches built into the handle of a flash-lamp, and the entire system (including flash-lamps) was powered by lead-acid batteries. Mann went on to be an early and active researcher in the wearables field, especially known for his [1994](/1994) creation of the *Wearable Wireless Webcam* (Mann 1997). Though perhaps not technically "wearable," in [1986](/1986) Steve Roberts built Winnebiko-II, a recumbent bicycle with on-board computer and chording keyboard Winnebiko II was the first of Steve Roberts' forays into nomadic computing that allowed him to type while riding (Microship).

In 1989 Reflection Technology marketed the Private Eye [head-mounted display](/head-mounted-display), which scanned a vertical array of [LEDs](/led) across the visual field using a vibrating mirror. The display (designated the "P4") was a 720 x 280 pixel monochrome (red) monitor in a 3.5" X 1.5" X 1.25" package. Screen size was 1.25" on the diagonal, but the image appeared to be a 15" display at 18" away. This display gave rise to several hobbyist and research wearables, including Gerald "Chip" Maguire's *IBM / Columbia University Student Electronic Notebook* (Bade 1990), Doug Platt's *Hip-PC* and [Carnegie Mellon University](/carnegie-mellon-university)'s *VuMan 1* (wearablegroup.org) in 1991. The Student Electronic Notebook consisted of the Private Eye, Toshiba diskless AIX notebook computers (prototypes) and a stylus based input system plus virtual keyboard, and used direct sequence spread spectrum radio links to provide all the usual TCP/IP based services, including [NFS](/network-file-system) mounted file systems and X windows, all running in the [Andrew Project](/andrew-project) environment. The Hip-PC included an Agenda palmtop used as a chording keyboard attached to the belt and a 1.44 megabyte floppy drive. Later versions incorporated additional equipment from Park Engineering. The system debuted at "The Lap and Palmtop Expo" on April 16th, 1991. VuMan 1 was developed as part of a Summer-term course at [|Carnegie Mellon](/carnegie-mellon-university)'s Engineering Design Research Center, and was intended for viewing house blueprints. Input was through a three-button unit worn on the belt, and output was through Reflection Tech's Private Eye. The CPU was an 8 MHz 80188 processor with 0.5 MB ROM. The project later turned into a full research project in wearable computing that remains strong today.

In [1993](/1993) the Private Eye was used in [Thad Starner](/thad-starner)'s wearable, based on Doug Platt's system and built from a kit from Park Enterprises, a Private Eye display, and the Twiddler chording keyboard made by Handykey. Many iterations later this system became the [MIT](/mit) "Tin Lizzy" wearable computer design, and [Starner](/thad-starner) went on to become one of the founders of MIT's wearable computing project. [1993](/1993) also saw Columbia University's [augmented-reality](/augmented-reality) system known as *KARMA: Knowledge-based Augmented Reality for Maintenance Assistance*. Users would wear a Private Eye display over one eye, giving an overlay effect when the real world was viewed with both eyes open. KARMA would overlay wireframe schematics and maintenance instructions on top of whatever was being repaired. For example, graphical wireframes on top of a laser printer would explain how to change the paper tray. The system used sensors attached to objects in the physical world to determine their locations, and the entire system ran
tethered from a desktop computer (Feiner 1993).

In [1994](/1994) Edgar Matias and Mike Ruicci of the [University of Toronto](/university-of-toronto), debuted the "wrist computer." Their system presented an alternative approach to the emerging head-up display plus chord keyboard wearable. The system was built from a modified HP 95LX palmtop computer and a Half-QWERTY one-handed keyboard. With the keyboard and display modules strapped to the operator's forearms, text could be entered by bringing the wrists together and typing (Matias 1994, 1996). The system debuted at ACM's Computer-Human Interaction 1994 conference in Boston, and is now being productized under the name "half keyboard". The same technology was used by IBM researchers to create the half-keyboard "belt computer." Also in 1994, Mik Lamming and Mike Flynnat Xerox EuroPARC demonstrated the *Forget-Me-Not*, a wearable device that would record interactions with people and devices and store this information in a database for later query (Lamming, 1994). It interacted via wireless transmitters in
rooms and with equipment in the area to remember who was there, who was being talked to on the telephone, and what objects were in the room, allowing queries like "Who came by my office while I was on the phone to Mark?" As with the Toronto system, *Forget-Me-Not* was not based on a head-mounted display.

Also in [1994](/1994), [DARPA](/darpa) started the Smart Modules Program to develop a modular, humionic approach to wearable and carryable computers, with the goal of producing a variety of products including computers, radios, navigation systems and human-computer interfaces that have both military and commercial use. In July 1996 [DARPA](/darpa) went on to host the "Wearables in 2005" workshop, bringing together industrial, university and military visionaries to work on the common theme of delivering computing to the individual (DARPA 1996). A follow-up conference was hosted by Boeing in August 1996, where plans were finalized to create a new academic conference on wearable computing. In October 1997, [Carnegie Mellon University](/carnegie-mellon-university), [MIT](/mit), and [Georgia Tech](/georgia-tech) co-hosted the [IEEE](/ieee) International Symposium on Wearables Computers in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The symposium was a full academic conference with published proceedings and papers ranging from sensors and new hardware to new applications for wearable computers, with 382 people registered for the event. The conference continues to be the primary academic conference for wearable computing today.

### Wearables in Science Fiction


[![7of9.jpg](/web/20060725165628im_/http://www.metaweb.com/wiki/upload/b/b1/7of9.jpg)](7of9-jpg)[![JeriRyan-as-Seven.jpg](/web/20060725165628im_/http://www.metaweb.com/wiki/upload/8/89/JeriRyan-as-Seven.jpg)](jeriryan-as-seven-jpg)  
*The Transformation of Jeri Ryan's Character, Seven of Nine,  
in Star Trek: Voyager, is evident in comparing these two photos.*

Possibly the most well known fictional character using wearable technology is [Jeri Ryan](/)'s [Star Trek: Voyager](/) character, [Seven of Nine](/), a Borg liberated from the Borg Collective by Captain Katherine Janeway. Seven of Nine first appeared as part of a team of Borg invited aboard the Voyager as part of a temporary alliance between the Voyager and the Borg, a deal that exchanged free passage through Borg-controlled space in the center of the galaxy for technology useful for combatting Species 8472, a species which is winning a war against the Borg but is also hostile to Voyager. When Voyager provides the technology, the Borg renege on their agreement to not assimilate Voyager, and a battle ensues to capture borg on board before they assimilate the crew of the ship. Only 7 of 9 survives this battle, and Janeway decides to liberate her from the collective hive mind, seeing that Seven is a human. Most of Seven's implants are thus removed, however she retains nanites in her blood stream and a few innocuous implants which cannot communicate with the hive mind but enhance her functionality as a crew member of Voyager.

The character of Seven of Nine is widely credited with saving the show from cancellation, although many liberal and feminist fans heavily criticized Seven's tight jumpsuit (and Jeri Ryan's curvacious body), as well as the significant show focus on Seven's journey to regaining her individuality and developing an adult human personality.

Whereas the Borg as a plot concept had been heavily used in the Star Trek shows to promote the Luddite Prophesy and denigrate the use of personal technology to mediate reality, particularly as all Borg appeared like undead ugly monsters, the transformation of Seven into the appearance of a lovely, vibrant human being as an individual severed from the collective changed the meaning of the evil of Borgness from disparagement of technology to disparagement of collectivism, which is seen by libertarian fans of Star Trek to be a major sea change in the political attitudes of show writers.
