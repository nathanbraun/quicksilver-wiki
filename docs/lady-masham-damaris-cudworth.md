### [Damaris Cudworth Masham](/)



**Damaris Cudworth Masham** (1659-1708), English philosopher. Daughter of philosopher Ralph Cudworth, and friend of English philosopher [John Locke](/john-locke). She published two works on issues of theology, epistemology, and moral philosophy, and corresponded with [Leibniz](/leibniz) and Locke on metaphysical issues. In her published books, Masham argued for improved education for women and objected to double standards of "virtue" for women and men. Masham's work can also be seen as foreshadowing what might now be considered feminist ethics and epistemology: interests in connection as opposed to separation, rejection of asceticism, and rejection of the worship of pure power.
