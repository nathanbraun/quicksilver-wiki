From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Blackbeard is mostly known as a pirate along the
North Carolina coast who was most active a few years later (circa
1717). But pirates were obviously quite mobile. Teach was not unknown
in Boston and it's plausible to put him here in 1713.

"... Teach soon began to increase his reputation once again by  

creating his well-known Blackbeard persona. He knew that if he  

looked frightening then ships might surrender to him sooner. He  

let his hair grow and started a beard that would almost cover his  

face. He twisted his long hair and beard in pigtails and he was  

known to tie colored ribbons on the ends. During battle he put  

lit slow burning hemp cord under his hat near his ears that would  

smoke and envelop him in a cloud. To add to his menacing appearance  

he also wore several pistols (as much as six) along with his knives and  

cutlass at his waist. He himself created the name "Blackbeard" and  

soon his frightful image was well known. While in battle the opposing  

crew often surrendered at the mere sight of him in a rage, some even  

called him the Devil-incarnate. Obviously Teach's Blackbeard persona  

worked! The fear his new image created had the psycholigcal effect he  

wanted. ..."

> Blackbeard is known to have buried treasure on Gardiner's Island, in Eastern Long Island Sound, some 100 miles from Boston (or so). When captured, Blackbeard returned 24 casks of treasure to the Governors of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. As recently as the US Civil War, a Captain John Merrill was seen with pieces of 8 he'd claimed were buried on Pilot Island (now Tavern Island) in Norwalk, CT.
