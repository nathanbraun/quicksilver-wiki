 moebius chains 
an ingenious yet not perfect way to generate [entropy](/) [gradient](/) equivalence aimed at the given direction in some [dimension](/) OR [dimensions](/), thus producing a potential source of [energy](/energy) { identity symbol } generator of work force, made *deus ex machina* to power discreeet number ([mana](/mana) is expended in quantas, LIKE [energy](/energy), thus you cannot power an indefinite number of entities { identity symbol } things OR personae OR ideas OR idea-machines et caetera; the number of powered entities must be a real, possitive number, preferably with attribute prime value set to true' (a possible possitive resonance inductive loop)) of any thing { identity symbol } entity you [willt](/willt) to power (for example an [Icon](/icon)/[Idoru](/idoru), [Sephira](/sephira) OR [Daimonion](/daimonion)) OR by the manipulation of subjective OR core level (objective) [time](/) OR attention of a local universe area OR a person(s).
