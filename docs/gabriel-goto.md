### Stephensonia


*Here's to confusion. Clearly the **Gotos** of **Goto Engineering** are fictional, but life is indeed odd.*

***Tachibana  
*The Japanese Etrog****
Gabriel Goto is one of [The Ten](/the-ten) in [The Confusion](/the-confusion). His background story is told, starting on page 594. He's Japanese (although 'Nipponese' is the term more often used here), but he's originally from [Manila](/stephenson-neal-cryptonomicon-30-the-real-philippines-randy-pays-no-attention-to-it-alan-sinder). He's [Christian](/christianity), raised by Jesuits. He would be a [samurai](/samurai) if he had a master; instead, he's a ronin.

Some Japanese are possibly of ethnic Jewish descent ... which is why Shinto shrine seem to have [Sukkot](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-sukkot) decorations up on New Years' day. Sukkot commemorates the life of the Israelites in the desert during their journey to the promised land, the Land of Israel. During their wandering in the desert they lived in booths (sukkot). The Torah directs Jews to use four species of plants to celebrate the holiday: the lulav (palm branch), the etrog (lemon-like citron), myrtle, and willow.
Hosha'nah Rabbah - the seventh day of Sukkot - הושענא רבא
Shemini Atzeret - the eighth day of Sukkot - שמיני עצרת
[Simhat Torah](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-simhat-torah) - the finale of Sukkot - שמחת תורה
Curious how [Christianity](/christianity) loses and then regains the fictional Goto clan. Wonder what other instititutions go for the **[long view](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-20-most-disorderly-alan-sinder)**. Further ponder: the "real life" Goto family crest pictures an inedible orange-green citrus fruit native to Japan and visibly similar to the *etrog*.

### *Christian Japanese Samurai*


[Akira Goto](/http-www-mms-net-com-samurai-index-e-html) writes of his samurai spearman ancestor [Matabei Mototsugu Goto](/http-www-mms-net-com-samurai-matabei-e-html) and speculates if he was a secret [Christian](/http-www-mms-net-com-samurai-josui-e-html).

**Samurai**
[Many of the traditional ceremonies in Japan](/http-www5-ocn-ne-jp-magi9-isracame-htm) seem to indicate that the Lost Tribes of Israel came to ancient Japan. There's a bit of a mystery here. Even [PBS](/http-www-pbs-org-wgbh-nova-israel-losttribes3-html-japan)'s NOVA has visited this idea. Some Japanese suspect the **Ark of the Covenant** is hidden in the Mount Aso area.  There are those who claim that the Mikado, the Japanese emperor, is a descendant of the Hebrew tribe of Gad. 'Mikado' recalls the Hebrew word for 'his majesty the king,' 'Malchuto'. 
