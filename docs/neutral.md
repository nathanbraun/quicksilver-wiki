*Being neutral when confronted by **EVIL** will not activate what appears to be [Enoch Root](/enoch-root)'s superset of powers that seem to be based on the teaching of [Metis](/athena).  

     Cayuse? You think it was fired by a Cayuse? [Doug](/douglas-macarthur-shaftoe) demands. [Randy](/randy-waterhouse) admires that Doug, while skeptical, is essentially open to the idea.  

     No, Randy says, taking another step towards Amy, and straddling the antitank mine. The Cayuse are extinct. Measles. So it was made by a white man who is an expert in the hunting practices of Northwest Indian tribes. What else do we know about him? That's he's really good at sneaking around in the jungle. And that he's so totally fucking crazy that even when he's been injured by a land mine, he's still crawling around in the undergrowth taking shots at people. Randy's probing the riverbed as he's talking, and now he takes another step. Only six feet away from Amy now. Not just anyone -- he took a shot at [Amy](/america-shaftoe). Why? Because he's been watching. He saw Amy sitting next to me when we took that break, resting her head on my shoulder. He knows that if he wants to hurt me, the best thing he could possibly do is take a shot at her.  

     Why does he want to hurt you? Enoch asks.  

     Because he's **evil**.  

     Enoch looks tremendously impressed. *
