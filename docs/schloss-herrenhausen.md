# Schloss Herrenhausen

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

The palace of [Electress Sophie](/sophia-of-hanover). The main dramatic feature was actually outside the palace, Sophie's [garden](/http-www-hannover-de-deutsch-kultur-nah-park-herrenh-her-kart-htm). The garden was the arena in which Sophie truly held court and in it she would suffer no fools to interrupt her, least of all her own [son](/george-i-of-england). The garden is also where we see her die in the arms of both [Caroline](/caroline-of-ansbach) and the anthropomorhic [Teufelsbaum](/teufelsbaum).
