# Metaweb:Semantics

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

**[Metaweb](/metaweb) Semantics** need some [thorough discussion here](/metaweb-talk-semantics) before any [semantic link](/semantic-link) scheme can be designed for it.

Distinctions that are presently undisputed, that must be made in the text:

* between *fictional* and historical characters
* between **those mentioned in a Neal Stephenson novel** - and other [Stephensonia](/stephensonia) - and those with no key mention or importance in his novels
* likely, a similar distinction between actions they really took, and those that Neal has attributed to them via literary license
* between a [Metaweb:place](/metaweb-place) and a [Metaweb:person](/metaweb-person) - sometimes confusing with [noble titles](/noble-title) that conjoin both
