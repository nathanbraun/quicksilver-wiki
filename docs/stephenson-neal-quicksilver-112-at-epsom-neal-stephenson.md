# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:112:at Epsom (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

[Wilkins](/john-wilkins) did spend much of the Plague Year at a
nobleman's Epsom estate, working with Hooke and others. The real name
of the estate was Durdans and the real name of the nobleman was the
Earl of Berkeley. To create the fictional character of [John Comstock](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-john-comstock),
I have freely adapted elements from the lives of several English
noblemen of the time, including Berkeley, John Evelyn, and Edward
Hyde, the Earl of Clarendon.
