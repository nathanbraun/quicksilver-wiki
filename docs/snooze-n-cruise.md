## Definition


A bit of a [KOA](/http-www-koa-com) franchise chain, there are three castes of Snooze n Cruise citizenry:

1. Camper owners: these folks drive into a lot, plug their camper in, snooze, and can drive right out, without having to back up. Such cruise the highways and byways of the former United States, Canada, and Mexico.
2. Tenters: arrive in cars or motorcycles, or by hitchiking, these folks prefer to tent.
3. Riff-raff: those who sleep in what is referred to as "[the body lot](/the-body-lot)", individuals who sleep on the ground around heaters in a tarped over area. This is where [Hiro Protagonist](/hiro-protagonist) meets the former President of the [Temporary Republic of Kodiak and Kenai](/temporary-republic-of-kodiak-and-kenai).
