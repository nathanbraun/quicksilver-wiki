Michael Whelan's cover to THE UPLIFT WAR by that Brin guy.  


The above makes sense when you see [Sparky's Book List](/sparky-s-book-list).

Sparky just discovered he and NASA are exactly the same age.


There maybe spoilers here. But this was along the lines I was thinking ...

### ¿ More Ponderables + expansion upon ?


Who was the Royal Society member who'd lend Enoch a fine steed (ala Shadowfax)? It would have to be among the *Quicksilver* equovalent of General Robert Hunter - a governor/mayor of New York.   

  

An interesting question, as said RS member would not be a member of the Harvard faculty. I would venture instead that, as Enoch came from NYC, that it is a dutchman or other continental, perhaps a beneficiary of Sophie, et al. or an RS finance type, setting up Wall Street. Getting a horse is not a matter that one must go to a Royal Governor for. Recall that Root is seeking out Daniel at the behest of the Charlotte/Sophie bunch to mediate the Newton/Leibniz dispute. Young Hackleheber may have merely sent Enoch a bill of exchange for a horse that he could cash in with the other dutchmen on Wall Street - [Uncle Mike](/user-mlorrey)

### Sir John Floyer


¿ Sir John Floyer -- The significance of the work is his insistence on the value of accurate measurement of pulse rates, so that, as he says, "We may know the natural pulse and the excesses and defects from this in diseases." Sir John Floyer has been described as "fantastic, whimsical, pretentious, research-minded, and nebulous." In 1697 appeared *An Enquiry into the Right Use and Abuses of the Hot, Cold and Temperate Baths in England*, known in later editions as *The History of Cold Bathing*.

### "Asshat"



I don't know the origin of the word, or if it's regional or not, but I like it a lot, and my family has adopted it as a more acceptable alternative to the usual "assh***". We learned it recently on a mailing list where it was used by a Brit livinf in Finland, and it was new to many on the list, but Google is certainly aware of it.

 Thanks. The hat goes on the business end I gather. Thanks - [Sparky](/user-stsparky) 20:32, 2004 Oct 10 (PDT)

 The [Urban Dictionary](/http-www-urbandictionary-com) [shines some light](/http-www-urbandictionary-com-define-php-term-asshat) onto this term. --[Pat](/user-patrick-tufts) 11:55, 11 Oct 2004 (PDT)
My favorite definition follows - as my onetime Disney animation professor (One of NASA animators for hire as well) worked on Scrappy and considered it a worthwhile addition to the Doo family. My hero Jack Kirby also did at the end of his career in art. Heh. Bless you Pat.
 **asshat**: One who enters into a new environment without taking the time to learn any of the social rules of the place. Then they promptly make pretty much every social gaff you can imagine this side of shitting on the dinner table.
 You know, a moron.
 Scrappy Doo is one of the few existing examples of an animated asshat.

I split up an entry with many topics, the first one I came across; then I fully grasped that it was still evolving. I chose poorly; I'll try to simplify stuff not under active revision. Character pages, I think, next. - [Pronoiac](/user-pronoiac) 00:09, 22 Oct 2004 (PDT)

In memory of my beloved Great Uncle "Frank":
## Fritz Berger


Born October 24, 1904, left us to join his beloved Jenny and Gustl on November 4, 2004. Born in Vienna, Fritz survived Dachau and took Jenny and their son Gustav to [Shanghai](/shanghai), China, where his daughter, Ellen Esther and son, Gary Victor, were born. Coming to Southern California in 1951 with virtually nothing and speaking only a foreign language, Fritz and Jenny's hard work, personal sacrifice, and devotion to the family helped them achieve the American dream of owning their own home. The example they set, and the nurturing environment they always provided, enabled their children to later succeed in their own right. Fritzl's impish humor, iron will, and boundless love for his family, relatives and friends will be grievously missed. Our only consolation lies in knowing that he is among others who also loved and missed him. Services at 12 Noon, Sunday, November 7th, at Mount Sinai Memorial Park, 5950 Forest Lawn Drive, in the Hollywood Hills.

Hiya Lobster! Try punching up your article by experimenting with formatting. - Sparky 

- not sure if I am posting in the right area thanks for the encouragement - will try to do so for Tmxxine ;-)

#### Thank you


I c'n't express my gratitude for your expansions of my suggestions. Flowers and kisses. [A.A](/user-agquarx)

*> I was misdiagnosed as having Asperger's about 7 years ago. Jeepers - you look a tad like me from your blog pic.*

Yes, we are the Bearded Ones! AS can be a tricky diagnosis, and is oft confused with other things, e.g., ADHD. Our daughter is aspie, but since autism is a spectrum, and the "divisions" within it are not hard and fast, we've become more confortable with just using the term autistic. BTW, my wife Kathleen has a big site full of resources of the overall subject: [neurodiversity.com](/http-neurodiversity-com). - [DaveSeidel](/user-daveseidel) 03:58, 12 Feb 2005 (PST)
1. How many mutually exclusive (MUTEX) idea machines you can believe in at the same time? My personal statistic will be given after you ansfer. No I will not cheat. It's important. [ALinkA](/user-agquarx)

A. Many. Belief is a flexible thing. No one owns the truth. - [Sparky](/user-stsparky)

A2. On this, Sparky, you are wrong. Belief is flexible... truth is not. [Matt](/jcsupercar69)

While waiting for the next thrilling installation, I'd like to start going through [The Confusion](/the-confusion) and getting it as annotated as [Quicksilver](/quicksilver) is. Thanks - [Sparky](/user-stsparky) 09:23, 2004 Aug 31 (PDT)

Oddly had a Delta Flight Crew member question me about [The Confusion](/the-confusion) while I was going through the book. It was the British PB version. 2nd honeymoon went well.

Sparky, did Dudley have any maps of Portsmouth Harbor, New Hampshire? There is a crucial issue of the NH-Maine boundary thats been going on for a while and the more accurate and detailed historical maps we have would be a help. - [Mike Lorrey](/user-mlorrey)

The Daggit was a cybernetic pet that defended Boxie on Battlestar. I'm working on an extended article on positive portrayals of cybernetics and anti-luddite positions on super-human cybernetic organisms in society.
okay :D - [Sparky](/user-stsparky) 08:16, 2005 Feb 25 (PST)

Thanks for the pic. :-) The last con we (me and the family) went to was Otakon. Couldn't afford to go this year. - [DaveSeidel](/user-daveseidel) 09:48, 20 Jul 2005 (PDT)

No problem. This is getting really annoying that the folks at Applied Minds are not doing crap to fix the holes in the system. Makes me wonder if this is just one more rat maze experiment... [Mike Lorrey](/user-mlorrey) 14:11, 20 Jul 2005 (PDT)

I would be able to help more if I were an administrator with wonder twin powers.... [Mike Lorrey](/user-mlorrey) 14:26, 20 Jul 2005 (PDT)

I've been investigating these IP addresses and they all appear to be open relays or spoofs. I think in light of this it is imperative that we implement the security protocols I've previously recommended, otherwise this is going to continue. [Mike Lorrey](/user-mlorrey) 19:36, 20 Jul 2005 (PDT)

Well, I like WikiMinion, but it reminds me of an octopus trying to plug every new hole in a dike. The spammers are making the 'recent changes' page absolutely useless for real contributors (perhaps we can generate a version that only displays changes by legitimate registered users other than Wikiminion) and if we are not going to get pro-active at tracking down these bastards, I still think we should seriously look at only allowing registered users to edit pages, and require users register with captchas.[Mike Lorrey](/user-mlorrey) 11:18, 30 Jul 2005 (PDT)

She's having a baby around Groundhog Day? If the kid pops out and doesn't see his shadow, are you gonna put him back in the oven for another month???? :) Anyways, congratulations! [Mike Lorrey](/user-mlorrey) 22:28, 30 Jul 2005 (PDT)
There will be a fight if we do that I guess - [Sparky](/user-stsparky) 21:31, 2005 Jul 31 (PDT)
Thought you might resemble this [remark](/http-www-starterupsteve-com-video-conan-triumph-star-wars-html). [Mike Lorrey](/user-mlorrey) 17:47, 14 Aug 2005 (PDT)
## Quitting


I think it would be more effective to blank out the page text and simply protect it against editing, rather than deleting spam pages, as it seems that at least some of the spam is recreating the same usertalk pages. Todays spamming has done it for me. I'm not playing unless editing is restricted to registered users, new pages must be created by existing links on other pages (all these are being generated by a bot with no preexisting page link anywhere), and registration requirings captchas.[Mike Lorrey](/user-mlorrey) 09:16, 9 Sep 2005 (PDT)
