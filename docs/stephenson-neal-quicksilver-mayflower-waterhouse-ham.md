# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:Mayflower (Waterhouse) Ham

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Aside: Mayflower is the wife of [Thomas Ham](/thomas-ham).

Ham in the Bible, son of Noah. In biblical ethnography, Ham is the father of the nations Cush, Mizraim, Phut, and Canaan. In a story separate from the flood narrative, the legend related in the Book of Genesis and in the Qur’an suggests that Canaan was a son of Noah. The “Land of Ham” is a designation for Egypt in the Psalms. The Hamitic languages were named after this son of Noah. Noah is the grandson of Methusaleh, thus Ham is his great-grandson. Enoch fits in there somewhere.

It's Ham who gives the silver caduceus to the cynical 18 year old Daniel who in turn has given it to his young wife [Faith](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-faith-page-waterhouse) in the Boston Colony some 40 years later.
