D'Artagnan

[Charles de Batz-Castelmore, Comte d'Artagnan](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-charles-de-batz-castelmore-comte-d-artagnan), well known from Dumas' novels about The Three Musketeers, was also an actual historical personage. The actual, historical, personage was encountered by [Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:Jack Shaftoe](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-jack-shaftoe) at the Battle of [Maastricht](/maastricht). [Eliza](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-eliza) has apparently read the novel Les m√©moires de Mr d'Artagnan by Gatien Courtilz de Sandras, which was used by Dumas as source material for his novels.
