# Young Lady's Illustrated Primer

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

The **Young Lady's Illustrated Primer** is a text partially revealed in [Diamond Age](/diamond-age). It is basically an educational computer in the physical form of a book. It conveys a primary education by means of affective storytelling, which is probably the most traditional method of civilizing known to humanity. Reactive actors or [ractors](/ractor) are employed to add the affective inflection of meaning to words in the text, and interact with the Primer's owner, so, a [text version of the Primer is never acceptable in and of itself](/text-version-of-the-primer-is-never-acceptable-in-and-of-itself).

Although the story and world in which it is set are fictional, the fables in the **Primer** are seemingly of real and possibly immediate use in the real world we live in. For instance, to provide some primary education in certain concepts critical to mathematical education and critical use of knowledge for action. 

(*SPOILER WARNING*) In Stephenson's novel, the primer serves this purpose spectacularly well and enables the [Mouse Army](/mouse-army) to follow [Little Nell](/little-nell) to victory.

*One of the proposed [Metaweb:Projects](/metaweb-projects) might release the **Primer** into the [GFDL text corpus](/gfdl-text-corpus) or some equivalent based perhaps on [Creative Commons](/creative-commons), AND FINISH IT!*
