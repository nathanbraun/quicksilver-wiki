### Community entry: Cryptonomicon


Stephenson calls **World War II** the recent ***[Titanomachia](/titanomachia)*** - Among real people mentioned in the book are [Albert Einstein](/albert-einstein) and General [Douglas MacArthur](/douglas-macarthur). This tale encompasses all both theatres of war. *Cryptonomicon* is a sprawling novel by [Neal Stephenson](/user-nealstephenson) that is more a combination of historical fiction and contemporary techno-thriller than the science fiction of Stephenson's earlier works. It follows the parallel saga of cryptographers from World War II (see U-413, U-553, U-691, Enigma, [Alan Turing](/alan-turing)) and their descendants attempting to use modern cryptography to build a data haven in a fictitious East Asian island state and the political machinations that follow both efforts.

**The Old Soldier**

*Cryptonomicon* is notably heavy going for non-technical readers in parts. Several pages are spent explaining in detail some of the concepts behind cryptography, for example. Stephenson even includes the details of a real, near-unbreakable cypher algorithm, developed by [Bruce Schneier](/bruce-schneier), as part of the plot. Despite this, the book drew praise from both Stephenson's science fiction fan base and literary critics and buyers.

*Cryptonomicon* is billed as the first book in an as-yet-unnamed series. The [Baroque Cycle](/baroque-cycle) may be considered the 2nd - 9th books in the series, and a series within a series itself. The books are related by theme and [family relationships](/stephenson-neal-cryptonomicon-family-relationships).

The title is drawn indirectly from the *[Necronomicon](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-necronomicon)*, a fictional work detailed within the works of the writer [H. P. Lovecraft](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-h-p-lovecraft) and friends like [Clark Aston Smith](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-clark-ashton-smith) [Robert E. Howard](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-robert-e-howard) who gave us ***Conan the Barbarian***. When Stephenson came up with his title, he was not aware of the word's origin. He was directly inspired by the fictional book's appearance in [the Evil Dead](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-the-evil-dead) series of comedic horror films. Mining the same source material are [Penny Arcade](/http-www-penny-arcade-com-view-php3-date-1999-07-28-res-l) and [Megatokyo](/http-www-megatokyo-com-strips-0096-gif) with the use of the Necrowombicom; And, [Howard Hallis](/http-www-howardhallis-com-bis-cthulhuchick) makes light of this [Jack Chick tract](/http-www-chick-com-reading-tracts-0100-0100-01-asp) while talking of the [elder gods](/http-www-geocities-com-tribhis-cthulhutract-html) (which earned him a phony *cease and desist* letter). For more on along this line, see the [Cthulhu Mythos](/lovecraft-hp-cthulhu-mythos) page.
