# Wallace:David:Infinite Jest:1063:math errors (Dan Schmidt)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

wallace-l 26 April 1996:

Well, this is off the subject, but the math footnote reminds me of one
of the two things that ticks me off about Infinite Jest - the math
isn't very good. Some examples:

(p. 1063) `Function x, exponent n, the derivative's going to be nx + x^(n-1)'

Actually, it's nx^(n-1).

Maybe this last one is just a proofing error, but in general his hit
rate on being correct about math is below 50%, which is pretty
bad. Perhaps only people like me care.
