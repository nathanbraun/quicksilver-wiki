### The Grand-daddy of All [FOQNEs](/foqne)


We now know why the Chinese People's Revolutionary Army was looking so desperately for [Yamamoto](/yamamoto-isoroku)'s gold at the end of [Cryptonomicon](/cryptonomicon): they needed it to help destabilize the US dollar in preparation for an invasion of Taiwan. Putting the gold in the hands of some crypto-anarchists was nearly as good, so when [The Great Simoleon Caper](/the-great-simoleon-caper) resulted in the tanking of the [Federal Reserve Note](/) in 2004-2006, the US military was broke, unable to even buy oil for their ships, and unable to come to Taiwan's aid when the Red Army crossed the straits and took over Taiwan. It was a rice-cake-walk.

Lee Teng-Hui, former President of [Taiwan](/), having absconded with his running dog imperialist gotten gold from the island to southern California, set about founding a new, distributed homeland for the refugee Taiwanese Nationalist community. As nobody was willing to fork over one huge lot of land for a Taiwanese homeland-in-exile, he started buying up small lots, here and there, and finally declared his nation, Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong, a virtual archipelago of sovereignty among the chaotic and rapidly devolving political reality that was the United States.

Mr. Bush, of rapidly decreasing importance in the world, said, "Sure, Mr. Lee, always happy to have more prosperable and productivating yellow-americans. Why, you chinamen are in many ways even better than us caucusus-americans!" Dubya, of course, was merely interested in reducing the property tax rolls of California school systems owned and operated by the Socialist Education Association, and making things more difficult for Ahnuld to challenge him for a third term now that the 25th (er wuz it the 26th amendment had been overturned.

Mr. Lee quickly expanded across the US, buying up hotels bankrupted by the currency failure for pennies on the dollar.

NOTE: This is not fiction, this is merely history that has not happened yet.
