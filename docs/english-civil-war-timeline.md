The **English Civil War**[[1]](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-english-civil-war) broke out in 1642, largely as a result of an ongoing series of conflicts between the then King [Charles I](/charles-i) and Parliament. The Parliamentarian army was commanded by [Oliver Cromwell](/oliver-cromwell), which after much bloodshed and destruction, was ultimately victorious. The capture and subsequent trial of Charles I led to his execution by beheading in January 1649 at Whitehall Gate in London.
