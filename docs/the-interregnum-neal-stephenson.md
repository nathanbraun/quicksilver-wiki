# The Interregnum (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

This term is one way of referring to the period of time between the decapitation of [Charles I](/charles-i) and the restoration to the throne of [Charles II](/charles-ii).

One thing I think I observed during my reading about this topic is that this term carries some political baggage. I think that people who are pro-Monarchy and who revile [Cromwell](/oliver-cromwell) are somewhat more likely to call it the Interregnum. People who take the opposite view are more likely to call this interval the Commonwealth or some other such term. After I noticed this, I tried to get in the habit of putting the word Interregnum mostly in the mouths of Tories. There may be exceptions, however.

This is tenuous, but I thought I would throw it out in case someone wishes to submit a better-informed opinion.
