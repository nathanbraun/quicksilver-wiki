(Redirected from [Metaweb:Authored entries](/metaweb-authored-entries))

A **[Metaweb](/metaweb) authored entry** is written by one person who intends to maintain it themselves. If you have any input about it, click "discuss this page" and change the talk page. Do not edit the actual entry. 

In general it is an essay on one topic which is already part of the topic list. It is by a specific writer. The writer may be famous or not, and the essay may be balanced or one-sided. 

The name of the entry includes that of its author. So [John Wilkins (Neal Stephenson)](/john-wilkins-neal-stephenson) is an essay on John Wilkins by [Neal Stephenson](/user-nealstephenson).

The best way to create a new essay is to first create the link on the appropriate [intermediate page](/metaweb-intermediate-page). Intermediate pages are general topic pages that include links to authored entries, external links, and related entries such as page annotations.

If the intermediate page doesn't exist, consider creating one so that other users who link to the topic are likely to find your essay.

Things not decided about authored entries yet:

* can links be added by people not the author?


* can spelling be corrected?


* when someone writes a [Metaweb:communal entry](/metaweb-communal-entry) that others disagree with, should it be moved to an authored entry format, and nothing left as the communal entry? Or should it simply be copied so that others can edit the communal one? *Right now the latter convention is followed.*
