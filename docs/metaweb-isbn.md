# Metaweb:ISBN

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.



The Wikipedia software recognizes inline [ISBNs](/isbn);
for example: `ISBN 0-12-345678-9` becomes [ISBN 0-12-345678-9](/) (the dashes are optional).
This creates a [link](/wikipedia-links) to a special booksource page, with links to sites where one may search for the best price for the book or access information about the book such as reviews and reader reactions. It is important when making a link to not put a colon after "ISBN".

Some think that this is useful, as it allows readers to go to online stores and purchase books. However, ISBN numbers only identify a particular edition of a book, and the reader will not see the full range of versions of the book for sale. Please *do not* use ISBN numbers alone to identify books: add a proper citation as well as the ISBN. See [Wikipedia:Manual of Style](/wikipedia-manual-of-style), [Wikipedia:Cite your sources](/wikipedia-cite-your-sources).

The text and links for the special page can be found at [Wikipedia:Book sources](/wikipedia-book-sources). To suggest additions to the page, see [Wikipedia talk:Book sources](/wikipedia-talk-book-sources).
