# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:6:Cartesian number-line (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

[Descartes](/rene-descartes) pioneered the use of
number-lines as a way of measuring positions in space, and also
crossed them at various angles to handle two-dimensional space, but
the now-universal practice of crossing them at right angles to form an
orthogonal coordinate system appears to have originated elsewhere---so
"Cartesian coordinates" is a misnomer (see the Descartes entry in
Dictionary of Scientific Biography). Julian Barbour credits [Leibniz](/gottfried-wilhelm-von-leibniz)
with inventing "Cartesian" coordinates, however the idea is sufficiently
obvious that others may have come up with it independently. Other
sources have credited Leibniz with first using the term "ordinate" to
denote one of the axes, though this word was in use, to mean related
but different things, long before Leibniz was born. This is a
fascinating topic, but it is murky enough that I have avoided making a
big deal out of it in the novel.
