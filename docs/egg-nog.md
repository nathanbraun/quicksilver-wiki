# Egg nog

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

The history of eggnog starts in England. "Nog" is an old English word that was used to describe a kind of strong beer back in the seventeenth century. It was often used to toast one's health. It was also called an "egg flip". It was a drink more commonly enjoyed by the upper class  mostly because there was no refrigeration and all the farms belonged to the big estates. Those who could get milk and eggs to make eggnog mixed it with brandy or Madeira or even sherry. It became most popular in America, where farms and dairy products were plentiful, as was rum (which was far more affordable than the heavily taxed brandy). 

An English creation, eggnog descended from a hot British drink called a "posset", which consists of eggs, milk, and ale or wine. The recipe for eggnog (eggs beaten with sugar, milk or cream, and some kind of liquor) has traveled well, adapting to local tastes wherever it has landed. In the American South, bourbon replaced ale (though nog, the British slang for strong ale, stuck). 


Egg Nog

Ingredients: 
* 6 Eggs
* 1 cup + 1 tablespoon Sugar

* 1/3 cup Dark Rum (Captain Morgan for best flavor, but Myers is OK)
* 2 cups Whipping Cream

Directions: 
All liquids should be very cold. Refrigerate in advance. 

Beat the eggs for 2 or 3 minutes with an electric mixer at medium speed until very frothy. Gradually beat in the sugar, vanilla, and the nutmeg. Turn the mixer off and stir in the cold brandy, rum, whipping cream and milk Chill before serving. Sprinkle individual servings with more nutmeg.
