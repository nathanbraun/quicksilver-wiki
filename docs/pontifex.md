From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

This is [Bruce Schneier](/http-www-counterpane-com-schneier-html)'s **[Solitaire](/http-schneier-com-solitaire-html)** card deck based encryption solution

  ***[Enoch Root](/enoch-root)*** describes a cryptosystem code-named "Pontifex" to an needy nerd named ***[Randy Waterhouse](/randy-waterhouse)***, and later reveals that the steps of the algorithm are intended to be carried out using a deck of playing cards. These two characters go on to exchange several encrypted messages using this system. The system is called "Solitaire" (in the novel, "Pontifex" is a code name intended to temporarily conceal the fact that it employs a deck of cards) and I designed it to allow field agents to communicate securely without having to rely on electronics or having to carry incriminating tools. An agent might be in a situation where he just does not have access to a computer, or may be prosecuted if he has tools for secret communication. But a deck of cards . . . what harm is that?  

Some people think they can improve on the Solitaire cipher, while still making it possible to do "by hand" (without a computer).

Other people have developed ciphers that are even more secure, but require a computer:
