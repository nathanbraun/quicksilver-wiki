# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:513:d'Avaux (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

D'Avaux was a real historical figure, but just about everything he is described as doing in the Baroque Cycle, is fictitious. Accordingly to the (mostly anti-French) sources I was reading, he was an accomplished intriguer; which is to say that he served his King very effectively.
