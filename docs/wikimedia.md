From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

**Wikimedia** is a small nonprofit organization with a board of trustees of five members, three of whom are co-owners of Bomis Corporation, and two of which are to be elected from [Wikipedia](/wikipedia) editors trusted by these co-owners.

It operates the servers for all [Wikipedia](/wikipedia) projects and is probably the strongest influence on [mediawiki](/mediawiki) features, but, it does not control the [GFDL text corpus](/gfdl-text-corpus) or [GFDL](/gfdl) itself. It only controls a user interface through which GFDL materials are accessed. And that not particularly well, as the full text search often fails to work, and the site is very often down. It is also often the case that their [wiki management](/wiki-management) practices are sharply or deeply questioned.

Some suspect that "troll-formative injustice" plays a role in these problems. Others simply blame the load and sheer diversity of views of those who edit.
