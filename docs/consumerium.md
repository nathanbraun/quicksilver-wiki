From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

**Consumerium** is another project using the [MediaWiki](/mediawiki) software that will probably stress [authentication](/authentication) of pages in a [Wikitext standard](/wikitext-standard).

The project itself is to promote [moral purchasing](/moral-purchasing) by providing mobile front ends with the capability of reviewing the [comprehensive outcome](/comprehensive-outcome) of buying a product at the retail store shelf, by barcode, and determining if that outcome of buying it is morally acceptable. If according to your own criteria it is not, then, red lights flash, bells go off, etc., and what you consider a good reason not to buy that product is displayed. It's really a very good idea, and [Adbusters](/adbusters) and [Greenpeace](/greenpeace) launched or discussed similar projects before this initiative was taken. The project is in the R&D phase and needs more help.
