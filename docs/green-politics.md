From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

**Green politics** describes a broad range of theories all generally accepting moral, ethical, political and economic constraints arising from ecological constraints. That is, moral, ethical, political and economic systems are seen as *part of* or *constrained by* or *fitting within* ecological systems ("[ecosystems](/ecosystem)"). The [biosphere](/biosphere) as a whole is the most inclusive of these - see [Gaia philosophy](/gaia-philosophy) for the origins of this idea.

As the [theory of evolution](/theory-of-evolution) began to incorporate more and more elements of affective behavior, social and sexual selective pressure, and other (what are called) "artificial selection" factors, the biology and politics began to have common terms of reference. [E. O. Wilson](/e-o-wilson) for instance seeks a [biological basis of morality](/biological-basis-of-morality) which is very much in the vein of green political thought.

Culturally, green politics is often associated with the [peace movement](/peace-movement) and [Hippies](/hippie). Historically, green politics emerged in North America in the 1970s in response to the oil crisis and the conservation it prompted, Europe in the 1980s with the anti-nuclear movement. These movements merged and matured in the [1990s](/1990s) when some European "[Green Parties](/green-parties)" began to participate directly in power. Similar parties, based on a common list of [Six Principles](/six-principles) they share worldwide, now exist in every democratic country.

Tactically, green politics often focuses on decentralization and gaining full control of municipal posts before seeking regional posts. A key element of green politics is [bioregionalism](/bioregionalism) whereby borders are set by ecological and climatic factors - not by "[gerrymandering](/gerrymandering)" by politicians creating totally artificial districts that reflect only their own desire to be re-elected.
