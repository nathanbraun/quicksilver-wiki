I purchased one of these units 3 months ago (06-2004) as part of a three-pronged offinsive I planned to take against the child-eating mosquitos that lay in wait in my backyard.

I went with the model based on price ($ 150 USD delivered) and based on the manufacturer (Coleman). 

After 3.5 weeks I did not see much of a change. After 8 weeks, I saw massive progress. I have not been bitten by a mosquito in over 3 weeks. I have taken down our gazebo as a result. 

This unit seems to do a decent job of diverting the mosquitos away from our backdoor with CO2 and heat and some "attractant" that is said to drive them into a frenzy. The problem is that it does not have a vacuum unit to capture the curious mosquitos (as some of the higher end units do). This one has a sticky "mouse trap" type deal. I probably only captured about 200 mosquitos in 3.5 weeks. After 3 months, however, I think I killed enough females to have literally wiped out an entire race of them.

If I were to do it again, I would spend the extra 200 bucks and get this instead:![2500trap.jpg](/https://web.archive.org/web/20060727112016im_/http://www.coleman.com/coleman/mosquito/images/2500trap.jpg)

But for the money, you can't beat it. I will put it out in the yard in April in a preemptive 2005 strike.
