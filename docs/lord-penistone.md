# Lord Penistone

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

In [Quicksilver](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver), a footnote states that King Charles II selected this title so that the otherwise puritanical [Knott Bolstrood](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-knott-bolstrood) would have to write the word "penis" whenever he wrote his name.
