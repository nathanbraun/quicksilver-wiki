### Latin


I'm sure everyone's Latin can handle this play of words targeting the Neo-Cons favorite *id√©e fixe* -- The New World Order. It is actually part of the Great Seal of the United States of America meaning *"a new order of the ages."*

It *may* have nothing to do with [Robert Anton Wilson](/robert-anton-wilson) or vast Illuminati conspiracies. It is likely why Avi, Randy and Epiphyte Corp are hip enough for TURING magazine.

### Novus Ordo Seclorum:A New Order of the Ages


Beneath the pyramid on the reverse side of the Great Seal is the Latin phrase "Novus ordo seclorum." Charles Thomson chose this motto, probably borrowing it from Virgil, the famed Roman poet who lived in the first century B.C.E. 

Virgil wrote the phrase "Magnus ab integro seclorum nascitur ordo" in the fifth line of his Eclogue IV. It has been translated in different ways, including: 

A mighty order of ages is born anew. 
The great series of ages begins anew. 
The ages' mighty march begins anew. 

Virgil's Fourth Eclogue expresses the longing of the world for a new era of peace and happiness. 

"Now the last age by Cumae's Sibyl song has come and gone, 
and the majestic roll of circling centuries begins anew . . . 
the Iron age shall cease, the Golden race arise . . . 
and shall free the earth from never-ceasing fear." 

Thomson coined the motto: Novus ordo seclorum. The preferred translation, according to the U.S. State Department, is: "A new order of the ages."
