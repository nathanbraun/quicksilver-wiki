# Occasionally annoyed

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

One COULD become so annoyed that One COULD imagine that nothing is unary nor binary xor nothing is forever without end and the Self within. Parle? Joking. This is not a path of negotiations. This is. Or not. Decide for your Self. One MUST consider binary narrative and imagine absolute ambigious antisense folding of the series, which might, or might NOT lead to mostly harmless con sequences'. All the statements in this memoplex are exceptions to binary logic, thus cannot be evaluated to (true' symbol) XOR (false' symbol) AND (self : symbol'). If you are, please [sign me](/sign-me) a postcard or something whatever nevermind.
