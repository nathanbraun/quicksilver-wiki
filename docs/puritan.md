**The Ideal Puritan Landscape**

The Puritans were a group of radical Protestants which developed in England following the Reformation, and played a significant role in the religious turmoil of the 17th century. 

#### Beginnings


Puritanism arose in the 1560s out of the discontent of radical protestants over the Elizabethan Religious Settlement of the Church of England, which the radicals claimed established a Catholic Church under the control of the Monarch, something that the radicals were opposed to (they described Anglicanism as a "Mingle Mangle"). 

"Puritan" was orginally a derogatory term, used by Anglo Catholics to mock the radicals' belief that the Church was corrupt and needed to be purified. However, within a few years radicals used the term "Puritan" as a badge of honour. Puritans were also known as "Dissenters" and "[Levellers](/levellers)"

#### Beliefs


The central tenant of Puritanism was a belief in that by following the teachings of the Bible (in particular that of the New Testament), people live holier lives and stand a better chance of salvation. 

Other important beliefs included: 
 Social justice and reform 
 Personal morality 
 Education and enlightenment for the masses 
 Simple clothes for priests 
 Simple ceremonies in Church 
 Simple decorations (if any) in Churches. 
 No superstition 
 No incense etc. 
 Abolition of Church Hierarchy 
 Against the Monarch being head of the Church 
 Most groups believed the Divine Right of Kings was heresy. 

#### Denominations of Puritanism


Puritanism was never a coherent, organised movement. Instead, it was a loose coalition of radical churches opposed to the Anglican Church. The largest of these groups were the Independents, the most influential in Parliament(and a thorn in the side of the Monarchy), were the Presbyterians. Other groups included the Society of Friends and the Separatists. 

#### Persecution


Puritanism was regarded as dangerously revolutionary by the Monarchy, who were particulary disturbed by the Puritans efforts to educate the poor and the Puritans' pamphlets attacking the power of Bishops (especially the Marprelate Tracts). Puritan members of parliament were taken to the Tower when they disagreed with the official line, known Puritans were spied on by Elizabeth's secret police, and Puritan meetings were broken up by the militia, all of which stiffened the Puritans' morale and made bloody revolution more likely. Because of this persecution, many Puritans fled to America, where they founded several colonies in New England. 

It may be noted that persecution in America was sometimes carried out by the Puritans against others. Besides the infamous Salem witch trials, a notable example is the persecution of the Maryland colony by the Puritans, who had first fled to Maryland seeking refuge from Virginia. 

#### Revolution and the Commonwealth


The English Civil War was a religious and political revolution between the Puritans and the Monarchy allied with Church. The Parliamentary and Puritan forces of Oliver Cromwell defeated and executed Charles I. Cromwell then established, for the first time in British history, a government that was tolerant of other religions (it allowed Jews to return to England for example), and also one that tried to help and educate the poor.

#### Puritans to Non Conformists


After the restoration, Puritans became known as Non Conformists and were persecuted by the Monarchy, although as a result of the Commonwealth, there were now many Puritans inside the Anglican Church. They became known as Low Church Anglicans, but had little influence in the High Church Anglican dominated Church until the twentieth century. Non Conformist means to "not conform" with the teachings of the Church, and that is how the Puritans are usually referred to today. Puritanism began to decline from about 1680.

#### The rise of Methodism


In the 17th century, Puritanism began to revive under the teachings of a man who argued that people should live their lives according to the method of the Bible. That man was John Wesley and Methodism was born. Despite some initial persecution, Methodism soon grew to become the largest of the Puritan denominations, a position it still holds. 

#### Descendents of Puritanism


The following denominations of Christainity are descended from the Puritans: 
* Low Church Anglicans
* Methodists
* Presbyterians (not including Ian Paisley's church, which is fundamentalist not Puritan).
* Congregationalists
* Society of Friends
* United Church of Canada
* United Reformed Church (Presbyterian and Congregationalist)
* Salvation Army


Some of the key strands of Puritanism also resurfaced in Unitarianism
