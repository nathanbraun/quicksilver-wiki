# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:744:letters to William of Orange (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Around this time it really did happen that a number of prominent Englishmen secretly sent letters to [William of Orange](/william-of-orange) soliciting his help in getting rid of [James II](/james-ii). I have inserted [Daniel](/daniel-waterhouse) into the story in the role of courier.
