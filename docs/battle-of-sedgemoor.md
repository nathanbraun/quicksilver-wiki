### Community entry: Battle of Sedgemoor


From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia with some edits. 

The Battle of Sedgemoor, fought on July 6, 1685, was the last battle on English (as opposed to British) soil and took place near Bridgwater in Somerset between the troops of the rebel James, Duke of [Monmouth](/monmouth) and [James II](/james-ii) of England in an attempt to seize the English throne. 

Catholic James II was the first in line of succession to the throne following the end of the English Civil War. Protestant James, Duke of Monmouth was the illegitimate son on of [Charles II](/charles-ii-of-england). 

After landing from the Netherlands at Lyme Regis in Dorset, the Duke eventually lead his untrained and ill-equipped troops on a night-time attack on the King's position on the site of Bussex Farm outside the village of Westonzoyland. Unfortunately the element of surprise was lost when a musket was accidentally discharged, and the Battle of Sedgemoor resulted in defeat for the Duke by the Earl of Feversham (also known as "Lord Feversham"). 

Monmouth escaped the battlefield, but was captured near Ringwood Hampshire. He was taken to the Tower of London in London where he was, after several blows of the axe, finally beheaded. 

The king sent the infamous [Judge Jeffreys](/judge-jeffreys) to round up the Duke's supporters throughout the south west and try them in the Bloody Assizes. About 1300 people were found guilty, many being transported abroad, while some suffered drawing and quartering.
