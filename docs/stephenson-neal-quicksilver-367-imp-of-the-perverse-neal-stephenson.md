# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:367:Imp of the Perverse (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Edgar Allen Poe wrote a piece called the Imp of the Perverse in the 19th Century, and so to put the phrase in Bob's (or Jack's) mouth in 1683 is likely an anachronism. But I don't know whether Poe actually coined the phrase, or picked it up from the vernacular. If the latter, then it might have been in use in 1683 or earlier.
