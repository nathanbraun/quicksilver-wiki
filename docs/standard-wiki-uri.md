# Standard wiki URI

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

A **standard wiki URI** has the following form:

protocol://language.domain.top\_level\_domain/wiki/editable\_version\_of\_page

The vast majority of links to the [GFDL text corpus](/gfdl-text-corpus) are of this form, which originated at [Wikipedia](/wikipedia). Unfortunately not all [mediawiki](/mediawiki) or [GetWiki](/getwiki) [GetWiki-based services](/getwiki-based-service) comply with this reasonable standard, and many (including [Metaweb](/metaweb)) make cgi and directory information visible in the URI they report as "the address" when pages are retrieved. This changes with each release of software, and is not information the user should try to remember. As with lack of an [interwiki link standard](/interwiki-link-standard), lack of such a uniform external **standard** for XML and HTML pages inhibits referencing and can only slow growth of the [Metaweb](/metaweb).

With such a standard that expresses language and editability in the URI directly, one need only swap domain names to find the parallel article, and URIs are easily remembered for citing on the radio, on the phone, in person, without having to look up "which [large public wiki](/large-public-wiki) uses which nonstandard."

*See [en:Wikinfo:standard\_wiki\_URI](/http-www-wikinfo-org-wiki-phtml-title-standard-wiki-uri) for further discussion of this and implementation potential for [GetWiki 2.0](/getwiki-2-0). It is not on the [MediaWiki](/mediawiki) radar at all.*
