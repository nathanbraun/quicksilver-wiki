# Greg Ritchie

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

I am feeling lost. I have yet to read the trilogy beginning with Quicksilver, and suspect it is part two of a pentrilogy which began with Cryptonomicon. I also suspect Greg Ritchie is yet another code name. But truly I know nothing, and as a suspect I now take my leave.
