### Community entry: Johann von Hacklheber


Johann's full name is Johann Jean-Jacques von Hacklheber.

The child of [Eliza](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-eliza) and [Bonaventure Rossignol](/bonaventure-rossignol), though publically it is assumed that he is the bastard son of Eliza and [Etienne d'Arcachon](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-etienne-d-arcachon), conceived before their marriage. At birth, he was given the name Jean-Jacques, for [Jean Bart](/jean-bart) and [Jack Shaftoe](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-jack-shaftoe).

When [The Ten](/the-ten) accidentally stole the Solomonic Gold, [Lothar von Hacklheber](/lothar-von-hacklheber) kidnapped Johann as retaliation against [Eliza](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-eliza), since he knew of her connection to [Jack](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-jack-shaftoe). He was lovingly raised by Lothar as a son, which is why he carries the von [Hacklheber](/hacklheber) name.

#### The System of the World


He is the lover of [Caroline of Ansbach](/caroline-of-ansbach) and duels with [Mr Braithwaite](/mr-braithwaite) to save her.
