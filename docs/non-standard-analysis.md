This is a stub for **non-standard analysis**

**Non-standard analysis** is that branch of mathematics that is concerned with analysis using the non-[Archimedean](/archimedean) ordered field of [hyperreal numbers](/hyperreal-number). It can be seen as the use of [model theory](/model-theory) to study analysis. Since studying the saturated model of a theory is easier than studying other models, non-standard analysis studies the saturated model of theories with many symbols thrown in to make sure results are applicable. 

One kind of elements in the saturated model are **[infinitesimals](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-infinitesimal)**. It is consistent for a positive non-standard **[real number](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-real-number)** to be smaller than any element of { 1/n | n in **N** }; thus, there is a positive non-standard real number smaller than all of these. In fact, there is a whole **ideal** of non-standard real numbers. If we start from the **rationals**, rather than the real numbers, and divide the **ring** of non-standard finite rational numbers by the ideal of the infinitesimal rational numbers, we get a field (because it is a maximal ideal) -- the **field** of real numbers. This sometimes gives easier ways to prove results which are hard work in classical, epsilon-delta, analysis. For example, proving that the composition of continuous functions is continuous is much easier in a non-standard setting.

There are not many results proven first with non-standard analysis. One of them is the fact that every polynomially compact linear operator on a Hilbert space has an invariant subspace, proven 5 years before classic functional analysis techniques were developed that deal with such problems. 

Non-standard analysis was introduced by the mathematician Abraham Robinson in 1966 with the publication of his book Non-standard Analysis.
