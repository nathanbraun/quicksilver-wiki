Frequency analysis is the way to crack simple [cryptosystems](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-cryptosystems) like the [caesar cipher](/caesar-cipher). It is based on the fact that certain letters occur in normal English sentences more often than others. The most common letters in normal English sentences are E, T, A, O and I; and the least common are Z, Q, X, J, and K. Therefore, if the letter P occurs most often in the ciphertext you are looking at, it is most likely that it is one of the first group of letters. Once a frequency table is built from the ciphertext, a cryptanalyst can begin guessing which letters match with which.
