Quicksilver should be defined further:  

'Nom de guerre' for Hermes AKA Mercury.

I kept notes on location, dates, and sometimes characters for the chapters. If anyone else is interested, where would those go? - [Pronoiac](/user-pronoiac) 01:28, 30 Sep 2004 (PDT)

That depends - there's the [Quicksilver](/quicksilver) main page for topics too broad to go in the more specific [annotations](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-all-annotations-by-page-number) page. People go on [List of people](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-list-of-people) or dramatis person√¶ page in respect to the book they're in. - [Sparky](/user-stsparky) 21:36, 2004 Sep 30 (PDT)

My notes: Consider them chapter thumbnails. They make it easier to jump around & find passages. Here's how my notes for Quicksilver start:
pg 3 - Boston Common, 12 Oct 1713, Enoch Root & Ben Franklin
pg 24 - Grantham, 1655, Root, Clarke, Newton, (Leibniz)
pg 34 - Massachusetts, 12 Oct 1713, Root & Waterhouse
...
There are dozens of these per book. I have them for Quicksilver & The Confusion already, with various levels of detail. - [Pronoiac](/user-pronoiac) 00:22, 1 Oct 2004 (PDT)

 K - Look at [Benjamin Franklin](/benjamin-franklin) and [Enoch Root](/enoch-root) and see they can go there. Welcome! - [Sparky](/user-stsparky) 21:03, 2004 Oct 1 (PDT)

 I'm not conveying this properly, so I'm just going to go do this thing. - [Pronoiac](/user-pronoiac)

There is a small difference in the UK and US paperbacks as in terms of extra goodies at the end ... - [Sparky](/user-stsparky)
