### [Sex Pistols](/)


**The Sex Pistols** was formed in August 1975 by Paul Cook, Steve Jones and Wally Nightingale. Nightingale left the band shortly afterwards, and the remaining members recruited bass player Glen Matlock and vocalist Johnny Rotten, who were among the clientele of the 'SEX' boutique in Kings Road, Chelsea. This shop (previously known as Let It Rock) was owned by the fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, and Situationist-inspired impresario Malcolm McLaren, who had briefly been the manager of the The New York Dolls. McLaren became the new group's manager. The name, no doubt, was intended to bring to mind the male sex organ, but McLaren has stated that he wanted the band to be "sexy assassins" (in later years band members frequently accused McLaren both of cheating them financially, and of claiming credit for things that were not his idea). Under McLaren's guidance, the band was initially influenced in part by the simple, chord-based style of The New York Dolls and The Ramones (McLaren had given guitarist Jones the Les Paul guitar used by NY Doll Sylvain Sylvain, and the torn-shirt, spiked-hair look of Richard Hell, bass player for Television. All of these figures were doyens of the New York [City](/city) punk, and later new wave music, scene. McLaren also claimed that he wanted the Sex Pistols to be "the new Bay City Rollers". ...

### [Anarchy in the U.K.](/)


[![Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols](/web/20060725171809im_/http://www.metaweb.com/wiki/upload/d/d7/Nevermindthebollocks.jpg)](never-mind-the-bollocks-here-s-the-sex-pistols)  

[Never Mind the Bollocks](/)  

is an album by the British punk rock band  

the Sex Pistols. Released October 28, 1977  

on Virgin Records, it was the only 'official'  

album of their career, although after the  

band split up numerous compilations  

and bootlegs including **The Great Rock  

And Roll Swindle** (the soundtrack to  
Malcolm McLaren's  

film loosely based around the Sex  

Pistols) and Spunk (pirated unreleased  

versions of basically the same songs as  

NMTB recorded for A&M Records) were  
to appear.

"Anarchy in the U.K." (B-side "I Wanna Be Me") was the first single by the punk band the Sex Pistols released on November 26, 1976, and is thus frequently considered to be the first punk single (although The Ramones released Blitzkrieg Bop a year earlier). It only reached number 38 on the UK pop charts before EMI stopped pressing it on January 6, 1977, but its long-term influence was substantial. The group's follow-up single, "God Save The Queen", reached number 2. Both songs later appeared on the album Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols.

The song's lyrics espouse a nihilistic, emotive, and violent concept of anarchy that does not correspond to the views of any major trend of anarchist philosophy. The lyrics can be interpreted as satirical, mocking not only the government but also directionless or purely fashionable rebellion.

The song was covered by Megadeth on their 1988 album So Far, So Good... So What!, with famously incorrect lyrics ("...and other council tendencies" was sung as "...and other cunt-like tendencies.")

### [Never Mind the Bollocks](/)


The promise of the band's early singles was eventually fulfilled by the group's first album Never Mind The Bollocks Here's The Sex Pistols, released on October 28, 1977. (Producer Chris Thomas took a different approach from earlier punk records, achieving a very clear sound layered with multiple guitar overdubs.) The album included singles "Pretty Vacant" (released on July 2, 1977), an ode to apathy, and "Holidays in the Sun" (released on October 15, 1977). Again the band faced controversy when a record shop in Manchester was threatened with prosecution for displaying the album's 'obscene' cover, although the case was overturned when defending QC John Mortimer produced expert witnesses who were able to demonstrate that the word "bollocks" was a legitimate old English term originally used to refer to a priest, and that although the word is also slang for testicles, in this context it meant 'nonsense'.

### Anarchy in the U.K. Lyrics


 Right! Now! ha, ha,
 I am an Antichrist!
 I am an anarchist!
 Don't know what I want!
 But I know how to get it!
 I wanna destroy the passerby!

 'Cause I wannabe Anarchy!
 No dogs body!

 Anarchy for the U.K.?
 It's coming sometime and maybe...
 I give a wrong time, stop a traffic line!
 Your future dream is a shopping scheme!

 'Cause I wannabe anarchy...
 In the city!?

 How many ways to get what you want?
 I use the Best!
 I use the Rest!
 I use the Enemy!
 I use Anarchy!

 'Cause I wanna BE Anarchy!
 It's the only way to BE!!!

 Is this the M.P.L.A or...?
 Is this the U.D.A or...?
 Is this the I.R.A?
 I thought it was the U.K.!?
 Or just another country...?
 Another council tenancy!

 I Wannabe anarchy!
 I Wannabe Anarchy!!!
 Oh, what a Name!

 I wanna BE Anarchy!!!
 'Know what I MEAN?

 And I wannabe an Anarchist!!!
 Get pissed?
