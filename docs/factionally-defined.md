# Factionally defined

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

To be factionally defined is...

1. ...to have the meaning of a word, phrase or concept determined by a [faction](/faction) or [factions](/faction).

For example, if 100 people, half belonging exclusively to faction A and the other half to faction B, were to discuss the lighting in their meeting room, their opinions might differ along faction lines.
Group A might consist of people used to very high levels of visible light, and they might say the lighting is "dim." Group B might consist of nocturnal people used to low levels of light, and they might say the lighting is "bright." Therefore whether the lighting in the room is dim or bright depends on what faction to which you belong, even though both factions experience the same level of light in the room.


* The statement claiming the existence of [factions](/metaweb-phyle) here is not demonstratably true (a single entity with many IP addresses available is not a group); It is shabby politics with the goal of generating a phony dilemma.

2. ...to be described by the characteristics of a [faction](/faction) or [factions](/faction).

A person might be factionally defined if they live their life according to the rules and principles of a faction(s).

Actually [personhood](/personhood) is a strictly legal concept, so this is always true. Slaves, women, corporations and great apes all are or are not persons based on who you ask.

 **[Personhood](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-person)** is an elastic concept to contributors to the **[Metaweb](/main-page)**. We extend it to the fictional creations and *snarky* AI agents of [Neal Stephenson](/neal-stephenson); We'd stand behind the good Jane Goodall's demand for apes being recognised as people.
