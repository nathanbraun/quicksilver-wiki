# Metaweb:Etiquette

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

**Metaweb Etiquette** are the most basic [Metaweb:governance ideas](/metaweb-governance-ideas) that affect line by line interactions, especially on [Metaweb:Talk](/metaweb-talk) pages. They are practices to embrace, and avoid:

* On a [Metaweb:talk](/metaweb-talk) page, which one reaches by clicking on "discuss this page", threaded comments are the norm. Inline threading, which is common in news and email, and block threading, used on blogs, are both valid. If you dislike the conventions some other person applies, just stop talking to them. No one standard applies, but, attributions must remain clear so that there is no chance one user's views can be confused with another.


* On a [Metaweb:policy](/metaweb-policy) page, there will be rather stricter attention paid to details of comments, and brief inline comments may be included to reflect dissent from the policy. Longer discussions should take place on the policy page's [talk](/metaweb-talk) page.


* On a [Metaweb:article](/metaweb-article) page, also called a "community entry", a [Metaweb:neutral point of view](/metaweb-neutral-point-of-view) applies. Anyone may edit what is said to be more neutral, meaning, to attribute a view to a specific group or authority. This is different from a [Metaweb:essay](/metaweb-essay) page, which is authored only by one person, and can only change with the permission of that one primary author.


* A [Metaweb:article\_talk:](/metaweb-article-talk) page is only for discussing the contents or priorities of that article.


* On a [Metaweb:User](/metaweb-user) page, the User controls all the content - it is basically a [Metaweb:essay](/metaweb-essay). No standard format applies to these pages, save the conventions regarding vandalism (no threats, abuse, spam, etc.)


* A [Metaweb:User\_talk](/metaweb-user-talk) page is for talking to the User: - since they need not answer you, they may well remove your comment, or put it on some other page. You are granting permission for this by using the [User\_talk:](/user-talk) page instead of an article [talk:](/talk) page.
