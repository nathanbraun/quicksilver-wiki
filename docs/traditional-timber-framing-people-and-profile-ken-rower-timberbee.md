[Ken Rower](/http-www-tfguild-org-pubpg-html) the long time editor of "Timber Framing" the Journal of the [Timber Framers Guild of North America](/http-www-tfguild-org-index-html), has been something of the Man Behind The Scenes, these many years. Timberframing has always delivered strong, well articulated voices from every Faction, minor and major. Under Ken's hand Timberframing has been a source of controversy and challenge, both of which are vital elements of growth.
