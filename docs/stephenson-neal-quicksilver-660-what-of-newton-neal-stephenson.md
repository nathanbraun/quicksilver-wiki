# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:660:What of Newton? (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

What is presented in this chapter is a fictionalized account of how [Newton](/isaac-newton) came to write [Principia Mathematica](/principia-mathematica). The historical truth can be found in many books, notably Westfall's Never at Rest. A quick way of summarizing it is that in this novel, the fictional characters [Roger Comstock](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-roger-comstock) and [Daniel Waterhouse](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-daniel-waterhouse) are shown playing roles that are very loosely analogous to what [Edmund Halley](/edmund-halley) did in real life.
