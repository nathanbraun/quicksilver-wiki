### Stephensonia


  *"It is whispered that in the old days, when the U-Stor-It was actually used for its intended purpose (namely, providing cheap extra storage space to Californians with too many material goods), certain entrepreneurs came to the front office, rented out 10 by 10s using fake IDs, filled them up with steel drums full of toxic chemical waste, and then abandoned them, leaving the problem for the U-Stor-it Corporation to handle. According to rumors, U-Stor-It just padlocked those units and wrote them off. Now, the immigrants claim, certain units remain haunted by this chemical specter. It is a story they tell their children, to keep them from trying to break into padlocked units.*
No one has ever tried to break into Hiro and Vitaly's unit because there's nothing in there to steal, and at this point in their lives, neither one of them is important enough to kill, kidnap, or interrogate...."

### Living La Vida U-Stor-It

*Standard U-Stor-It facility*

As they say, it isn't camping if you have no home to go home to. [Hiro](/hiro) and [Vitaly](/vitaly-chernobyl-and-the-meltdowns) at least can still go camping, and come home to their storage unit in the franchise ghetto, living under the loglo and the flight path of LAX. A 10 by 10 storage unit is dubiously a step up from a body locker at [Spectrum 2000](/spectrum-2000) for those of the Do-It-Yourself set who don't mind a milk crate and cargo pallet furniture theme with corrugated steel wall patterns.

Hiro, being a hard core hacker and the world's greatest swordsman (which world, exactly, is left vaguely unmentioned on his business card) fits into this locale quite nicely, as does his Russian fuzz-grunge rocker roomie, who at least has the option of living in his van when 'camping'.

Hiro generally doesn't care about the locale, because not many people get phased in this neighborhood when he is practicing his samurai skills with his length of rebar known as the [Redneck Katana](/redneck-katana), and besides it saves his meager savings to pay for his bandwidth bill to access the [Metaverse](/metaverse), where his real life is anyways.

As they say, on the internet, nobody can tell if you are a dog. In the Metaverse, nobody can tell from your avatar that you live at the U-Stor-It, so what is the point of keeping expensive digs in reality if you spend all your time in virtuality? Of course, Hiro can get away with this because he has no girlfriend to make unrealistic expectations of him that he needs to be guilted into fulfilling. 

In the Metaverse, Hiro is a Warrior Prince, and no amount of real world poverty can take away that sort of nobility. The poor noble was a common occurence once, back in the days of [Quicksilver](/quicksilver), they were "thick on the ground" across much of Europe then. Hiro's riches are stored up in his mother's retirement [burbclave](/burbclaves) life in Korea.

### Affordable Housing



In the 1990's, Silicon Valley and much of the rest of California saw massive escalation in real estate values. Rents, as a result, went through the roof, leading to many low level tech workers living in public parks, cleaning up at the YMCA, before heading off to their white-collar job at some dot com. Currently in 2005, technicians earning $50k/yr are in the 'living in crate' lifestyle.

Dotcommers with money to burn were widely known to walk up to the doors of homeowners and offering $750k-1.5m dollars for a run-of-the-mill tract house or bungalow, when the homeowner had not even inkled of putting the house on the market. Massive borrowing on one's dot com stock portfolio was commonplace. Getting that borrowing paid off before the crash with cashed out stocks was a gamble.

Valley tech workers seem to have been prevented from turning self-storage units into suburbs only by the presence of a strong governmental building bureaucracy.

There are now several housing developments that are stacked, prefabbed containers built as apartments, going up in several european locales, primarily on college campuses. The dutch firm [SpaceBox](/http-www-spacebox-info-index-eng-htm) designed and produced these stackable modular studio apartments. This technology was recently featured in the [Treehuggers blog](/http-www-treehugger-com-files-2005-01-almost-spacebox-php).
