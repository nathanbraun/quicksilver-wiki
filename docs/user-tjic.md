From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

I am a real person, invited to join the metaweb by  [Patrick Tufts](/user-patrick-tufts).

I started reading 
[Neal Stephenson](/user-nealstephenson) around 1988 when I found a remaindered copy of \_The Big U\_.

I'm a professional software engineer and amateur { carpenter | machinist | woodworker | gunsmith }.
