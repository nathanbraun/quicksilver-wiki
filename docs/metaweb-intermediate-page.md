# Metaweb:Intermediate page

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

An **intermediate page** links together multiple Metaweb nodes about the same topic.

#### Intermediate page template


Here is a template for an empty intermediate page. You can cut and paste the code below into the edit box for a new intermediate page. You must fill out the topic name and give at least one entry for one of the four fields (authored, community, related, and external) for the intermediate page to be useful.

For fictitious characters, you may want to delete the *external links* section.

This presents links to meta-pages on [Authored entries](/metaweb-authored-entry), [Community entry](/metaweb-community-entry), [Related entries](/metaweb-related-entry), and [External links](/metaweb-external-links).
