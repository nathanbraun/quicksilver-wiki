# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:850:Eleanor and Caroline (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

These are real characters, and their biographies, as given in the novel, more or less tally with the historical account. However, this business of their getting caught up in the invasion of the Palatinate and ending up in the Hague as refugees is fictional. I think it is reasonably plausible though.
