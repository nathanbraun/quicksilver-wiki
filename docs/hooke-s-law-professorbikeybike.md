From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Hooke's law is the general law of mechanics which states that stress is directly proportional to strain.

In 1676, Robert Hooke stated that *The power* (sic.) *of any springy body is in the same proportion with the extension* and is thus credited with developing the law of the same name. 

Mathematically, this is to say that

**F = *k* Â· u**

Where **F** is the applied force (not *power* as Hooke suggested), **u** is the deformation of the body (usually a spring in textbook examples), and ***k*** is the spring constant.

There are many basic examples, and very complicated three-dimensional extensions of this law that might make their way here at some point.
