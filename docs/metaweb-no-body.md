# Metaweb:No body

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

*This is a [Metaweb:proposed policy](/metaweb-proposed-policy). If one or more named [Metaweb:authors](/metaweb-author) agree with it, then it becomes a [Metaweb:draft policy](/metaweb-draft-policy). Until then, it is here only as a [Metaweb:straw man](/metaweb-straw-man) to begin a discussion.*

If something posing as a [Metaweb:contributor](/metaweb-contributor) has **no body** behind it (that is, it does not really represent the committed views of [Metaweb:some body](/metaweb-some-body)), but is a fictional construct or simply a bot, or is repetitively quacking some [Metaweb:ideology](/metaweb-ideology) not tied to any body that is actually threatened or constrained, we don't owe it quite the consideration we'd owe a real living body with the same emotions as we feel.

In other words, such entities can be blown off and their edits, votes, and bets, such as they exist, in the [Metaweb:namespace](/metaweb-namespace), blown off more or less at will. However, allowing this to happen without a [Metaweb:due process](/metaweb-due-process) is a serious mistake, as only unpopular views will get blown away, leaving a lot of popular propaganda behind. Therefore it is probably important to pair off "no body" influences and blow them away together. For instance, if there is substantial repetitive spouting of views from both sides of the Israel/Palestine debate, it would only be fair to delete them, if both were to be deleted simultaneously at regular intervals. If both Coke and Pepsi were filling the metaweb with spam for their brand of sugar water, it would be quite unfair to blow off Coke but leave Pepsi's spam in place. So identifying the most operative [Metaweb:dialectic](/metaweb-dialectic) is probably quite important.
