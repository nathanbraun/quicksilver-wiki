# User:Qoq

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.


I've just recently joined but I have several items I'd like to comment on and perhaps come contributions to make.

Who I am: Bob Jernigan, a member of the Senior Professional Staff of The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. Any contributions I make to this are my own and have nothing to do with my work there.

My academic work is in Philosophy, primarily at Arizona State University. My history of computer work dates back to Dec, 1968, with programs to compute AM Radio broadcast patterns. My http experience started November 15, 1993 when we started testing the feasibility of updating Oracle databases with Rob McCool's server sending 10 MB (sic) updates from Excel. It's been an interesting trip. I see some names from the past associated with this web but would like to know who all is here.

My friends call me "Bob" and my Internet ids are usually "qoq", which is "bob" inverted, or "jern" but the latter is too scattered over the IETF archives to be of use. Your rendering machine changes "qoq" to "Qoq" -- not nice of it. Perhaps I can find a way to defeat that change.

I am also [jern](/jern) but don't yet when I'm who.:[jern](/user-qoq)
