# Hacker

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Used in the original context. Someone who is knowledgable, and to some extent cares, about computer programming, solving problems, etc. Often confused, particularly by the press, with "cracker", which is an individual who uses hacking skills for malevolent, even criminal, purposes, and does not give back to the hacker community.
