### French Diplomatic Ciphers


At least two different ciphers are used by [Eliza](/eliza-de-la-zeur) to communicate with d'Avaux. The first of these ciphers and most likely the second were broken by the French *[Cabinet Noir](/cabinet-noir)*, so it is very unlikely that either is the Great Cipher of [Louis XIV](/louis-xiv). However, we only see plaintext, and get no insight into the nature of the cipher.

### Great Cypher


In the history of cryptography, the Great Cipher was a nomenclator cypher developed by the Rossignols, several generations of whom served the French Crown as cryptographers. It was excellent of its class and so was given this name; it was reputed to be unbreakable. And, indeed, after it went out of current use, messages in the French archives (mostly diplomatic, apparently) were entirely unreadable.

Around 1893, Etienne Bazeries managed to break the Cypher and in so doing discovered a contemporary reference to The Man in the Iron Mask who was, it thus appeared, not actually only legendary. Unfortunately, the message (regarding his transfer from one prison to another) did not shed any light on his identity or crime.

### Étienne Bazeries


**Étienne Bazeries** (21 August 1846 - 7 November 1931) was a French military cryptanalyst active between 1890 and the First World War. He is best known for developing the "Bazeries Cylinder", an improved version of Thomas Jefferson's cipher cylinder. It was later refined into the US Army M-94 cipher device. Historian David Kahn describes him as "the great pragmatist of cryptology. His theoretical contributions are negligible, but he was one of the greatest natural cryptanalysts the science has seen." (Kahn 1996, p244)

Bazeries was born in Port-Vendres, France, the son of a mounted policeman. In 1863 he enlisted in the army, and fought in the Franco-Prussian War, where he was taken prisoner, although he later managed to escape disguised as a bricklayer. In 1874 he was promoted to lieutenant, and sent to Algeria in 1875. He returned to France the following year and married Marie-Louise-Elodie Berthon, with whom he would father three daughters: Césarine, Fernande and Paule.

He apparently became interested in cryptography through solving cryptograms in newspapers' personal columns, and soon applied his cryptanalytic skills in a military context when, in 1890, he solved messages enciphered with the official French military transposition system, causing the War Ministry to change to a new scheme. In 1891, news of his talent had spread, and he began work for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Bureau de Chiffre. Bazeries continued his cryptanalytic work there even after he retired from the Army in 1899, assisting in solving German military ciphers during World War I. He retired in 1924, aged 78.

In the 1890s he broke a famous nomenclator system called the "Great Cypher", created by the Rossignols in the 17th century. One of the messages referred to the infamous **Man in the Iron Mask**; regrettably, it did not identify him. His influential 1901 text Les Chiffres secrets dévoilés ("Secret ciphers unveiled") is considered a landmark in cryptographic literature.
