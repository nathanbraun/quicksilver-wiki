### Douglas MacArthur Shaftoe


He's clearly the one you want to have on your side in a bar fight but *there's no guaranty you'd make it out alive*. Looking a bit scary the crew cut wearing ex-SEAL **Douglas MacArthur Shaftoe** AKA **Doug Shaftoe**, owns and operates **Semper Marine**, saw fifteen minutes of fame back in 1975 when the crypto-hating United States Attorney General [Paul Comstock](/paul-comstock)'s father [Earl Comstock](/earl-comstock)  the Cold War policy guy called the *brain*s behind the Vietnam War  fell, or was pushed, off a ski lift in Colorado, and broke his arms. Seems Doug happened to be seated right next to him at the time.![Doug-Semper_Fi-MW.jpg](/images/Doug-Semper_Fi-MW.jpg)  
**Give Dean Cain  
a crew cut and pepper his hair  
Semper Fidelis!**


Doug looks to be around fifty, but he has the skin of an eighty-year-old Bedouin. He is the son of Glory Pascual and [Bobby Shaftoe](/bobby-shaftoe). Doug Shaftoe, like the best military people, displays a compulsive need to educate every one around them, all the time. [Randy Waterhouse](/randy-waterhouse) supposes that when you are in a war, practical knowledge is a good thing to spread around. Doug is also a master of deadpan humor. He's connected enough to get the loan of an incredibly expensive ROV from a buddy at the Naval Academy. And wise enough to know: ***That money is not worth having if you can't spend it.***

[Amy](/america-shaftoe) summed up her father: "Ninety percent of the time his presence is a sign that something really weird is going on."


He's so paranoid that he doesn't even trust Ordo to encrypt his e-mail but uses personal shared information such as *stupid jokes* to convey coded information such as locating the ***V One Million*** and rightly fears the Bolobolos: We keep it a secret from that son of a bitch," Doug Shaftoe says, jerking his thumb at Hubert Kepler. "Because if the Dentist finds out, then he and the Bolobolos will just split the entire thing up between them and we'll see nothing. There's even a chance we would end up dead.


### The Bolobolos


(Per [Avi Halaby](/avi-halaby))**Victoria Vigo** whored her way up out of Smoky Mountain. It's the only way she could have gotten out of there. Pimping arrangements were handled by the **Bolobolos**. This is a group from Northern Luzon that was brought into power along with Marcos. They run that part of town-police, organized crime, local politics, you name it. Consequently, they own her--they have photographs, videos from the days when she was an underage prostitute and porn film starlet. In some circles it's as well known as the value of pi. Her interests are aligned with the Bolobolos and always will be. And **the Dentist** is always going to obediently do whatever his wife tells him to. Though he probably has a lot more money and power than the Bolobolos. He won't, he'll do what his wife tells him to because **Kepler** is a major control freak and thus a masochist. Pimps and Madams in Hong Kong, Bangkok, Shenzhen, Manila, they all had files on him--they knew exactly what he wanted. And that's how he met Victoria Vigo. He was in Manila, see, working on the FiliTel deal. Spent a lot of time here, staying in a hotel that's owned, and bugged, by the Bolobolos. They studied his mating habits like entomologists watching the reproductive habits of ants. They groomed Victoria Vigo--their ace, their bombshell, their sexual Terminator to give Kepler exactly what Kepler wanted. Then they sent her into his life like a guided fucking missile and pow! True love. He didn't know she was a whore. The Bolobolos set her up with a fake identity as a concierge at Kepler's hotel as a demure Catholic school girl. It started with her getting him tickets to a play, and inside of a year. he's chained to his bed on that fucking mega-yacht of his with strap marks on his ass, and she's standing over him with a wedding ring on her finger the size of a headlamp, the hundred and twenty-fifth richest woman in the world.

### Establishing A Cryptographic Protocol While Explaining *Due Diligence*


     In the crypto world, when you are explaining a cryptographic protocol, you use hypothetical people. Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Evan, Fred, Greg, and so on.  

     Okay.  
 
     Alfred invests his money in a company that is run by Barney. When I say 'run by' what I mean is that Barney has ultimate responsibility for what that company does. So, perhaps Barney is the chairman of the board of directors in this case. He's been chosen, by Alfred, Alice, Agnes, Andrew, and the other investors, to look after the company. He and the other directors hire corporate officers -- such as Chuck, who is the president. Chuck and the other officers hire Drew to run one of the company's divisions. Drew hires Edgar, the engineer, and so on and so forth. So, in military terms, there is a whole chain of command that extends down to the guys in the trenches, like Edgar.  
 
     And Barney's the man at the top of the chain of the command,  

     Doug says. Right. So, just like a general, he is ultimately responsible for everything that is done below him. Alfred has personally entrusted Barney with that money. Barney is legally required to exercise due diligence in seeing that the money is spent responsibly. If Barney fails to show due diligence, he is in major legal trouble.  
 
     Ah.  
 
     Yeah. That gets Barney's attention. Alfred's lawyers might show up at any moment and demand proof that due diligence is being exercised. Barney needs to stay on his toes, make sure that his ass is covered at all times.  
 
     Barney in this case is the Dentist?  
 
     Yeah. Alfred, Agnes, and the others are all of the people in his investment club -- half of the orthodontists in Orange County.  
 
     And you are Edgar the Engineer.  
 
     No, you are Edgar the Engineer. I am a corporate officer of Epiphyte. I am more like Chuck or Drew.  


### Doug In Danger


Doug can work with locals in tight situations. He's open to new ideas in ***Threat Situations***. And he's lovable. He knows when he is dealing with first rate minds.

### Thoughts


I'd appreciate if we any ideas as to legends of *Hero Fathers* come to mind.

Yeah, it seems the more 'capable' a dad is, the more of a 'hero' he is and remains in his kids eyes. My dad was an engineer who designed spy satellites, nuclear reactor cores, and deep sea submarines in my childhood, but it was more important that he taught me how to build my own tree house and soap box racer. He fixed toys, broken windows (especially when it was a neighbors window you broke with a baseball), small engines, and built massive electric train sets in our basement. He was a firearms expert who not only reloaded his ammo and was a marksman, but a wilderness tracker, an expert at anything around camp, and he taught me to fish, too. When I wanted a toy electric airplane, he said, no, and we built a model plane instead. He taught me how to calculate ballistic trajectories when I was in grade school, and we took programming classes together at night college when I was in 7th grade. While he was an Army veteran, having been drafted in the early 60's into a mobile artillery/armor unit in Colorado, he never went overseas, so the biggest stories he had were how all his Italian army buddies from New York so loved my grandmothers spaghetti sauce they renamed him 'Norm Lorelli'.
