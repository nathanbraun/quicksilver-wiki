## Another Logic Mill card



Membranophones are instruments whose sound is produced by a vibrating membrane usually a skin drum: Whereas, *the mirliton is a membranophone that is not a drum.* The membrane is activated by blowing or singing against it. Examples: Kazoo, comb and waxed paper, zobo. Mirilitons were used in the late 19th and early 20th to foster an interest in music by those without much talent for it.
