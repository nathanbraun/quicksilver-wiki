"What you did was a good step. You have added much several
ways, & especially in taking the colours of thin plates into philosophical
consideration. If [I](/lemuel-gulliver) have seen further it is by pissing on the shoulders of [Lilliputians](/lilliput)."

## Stephensonia


I have read several books by [Neal Stephenson](/neal-stephenson):
* [Snow Crash](/snow-crash)
* [The Diamond Age](/the-diamond-age)
* [Cryptonomicon](/cryptonomicon)
* [The Baroque Cycle](/the-baroque-cycle)
	+ [Quicksilver](/quicksilver)
	+ [The Confusion](/the-confusion)
	+ [The System of the World](/the-system-of-the-world) (not yet finished).


I didn't read [Zodiac](/stephenson-neal-zodiac).

I have also read the [The Great Simuleon Caper](/the-great-simuleon-caper) and [Mother Earth Mother Board](/mother-earth-mother-board) .
I am not sure if I stood the totality of [In the Beginning was the Command Line](/in-the-beginning-was-the-command-line).
