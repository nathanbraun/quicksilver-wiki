## The Battle of Bunker Hill


A major battle of the American War for Independence, aka The Revolutionary War. Was actually, primarily, fought on Breed's Hill, which was closer to Charlestown and had better artillery coverage of Boston Harbor.

After retreating from the [Battles of Concord and Lexington](/battles-of-concord-and-lexington) in April, 1775, the [British Army](/british-army) occupied [Boston](/boston) for several months. Realizing the need to strengthen their position in the face of increasing anti-British sentiment in and around Boston, plans were developed to seize and fortify nearby Dorchester Heights and Charlestown peninsulas. The peninsulas offered a commanding view of the seaport and harbor, and were important to preserving the security of Boston. The Americans caught word of the British plan, and decided to get to the Charlestown peninsula first, fortify it, and present sufficient threat to cause the British to leave Boston. On 16 June, 1775, under the leadership of Colonels Putnam, and Prescott, the Patriots stole out onto the Charlestown Peninsula with instructions to establish defensive positions on Bunker's Hill. For reasons that are unclear, they constructed a redoubt on nearby Breed's Hill. The next morning, the British were astonished to see the rebel fortifications upon the hill and set out to reclaim the peninsula.

General Howe served as the commander of the British main assault force and led two costly and ineffective charges against the Patriot's fortifications without inflicting significant casualties on his opponents. After obtaining 400 reinforcements which included sorely needed ammunition for his artillery, Howe ordered a bayonet charge to seize Breed's Hill. In this third attempt, the British were finally able to breach the breastworks of the American redoubt and the Patriots were forced to retreat back to the mainland.

This battle, though victorious, proved costly for the British. Of the 2400 British soldiers in Howe's command, the 1054 casualties accounted for nearly forty percent of their ranks. The American casualties were 441, including 30 captured, with most being inflicted during the retreat. The battle served to prove to the American people that the British Army was not invincible. It became a symbol of national pride and a rally point of resistance against British rule.

Of the Patriots involved in the battle, the largest contingent were not actually from Massachusetts, but from New Hampshire. Over 1,000 militiamen mustered from the towns of New Hampshire, bringing with them many barrels of gunpowder and cannon obtained from the prior raid on [Fort William and Mary](/fort-william-and-mary) in Portsmouth Harbor, in December, 1774. Interestingly, Boston Patriot [Paul Revere](/paul-revere) rode to Portsmouth prior to the raid, to warn locals of reinforcements being sent from Boston, a ride preceding his more famous ride to warn Lexington and Concord in April.

## The First Assault


The first assault came against the northern flank of the Patriot Line, commanded by New Hampshire Colonel [John Stark](/john-stark) (later to become General and hero of the Battle of Bennington, where he captured [General Burgoyne](/general-burgoyne)). Stark correctly perceived the attack would focuse on the end of the northern flank, on the beach of the Mystic River. He had his men construct a stone wall, extending the line of the rail fence to the water (see illustration). General Howe advanced his eleven companies of Light Infantry and Grenadiers along the beach and tall grass. Waiting until the columns of redcoats were within thirty five yards, the colonials opened fire in succession of ranks. Company after company of British soldiers were decimated before they could close to use their bayonets. The British fell back and regrouped. This is the location from which the famous order came, to not "fire until you see the whites of their eyes!"

## The Second Assault


General Howe regrouped his shattered Light Infantry and Grenadier columns. Realizing that the beach area was a trap, Howe sintended to exploit the weak area in the American center at the fleches. He sent his Light Infantry to attack the rail fence while Pigot assaulted the breastworks and redoubt. Howe reasoned that a general attack all along the American lines would keep them pinned down enough to breach their defenses.

Howe met the same resistance as in the first asssault. His companies were quickly shattered by the colonials. Stark and Knowlton's men rested their muskets on the walls before them for surer aim and paid special attention to British officers. At the redoubt, Pigot was given the same treatment. A steady stream of fire from the redoubt and breastworks ended the British advance and sent the survivors running back out of range.

## The Third Assault


General Howe decided on a new course of action. Using the remnants of his eleven companies of Light Infantry, he began a skirmish near the rail fence/ stone wall. This sporadic, ineffectual firing served to fix Starks' and Knowlton's men in place. Meanwhile, he sent elements towards the fleches and breastworks to overrun the Americans entrenched there. At the same time, General Pigot was to attack the southern end of the breastworks and the redoubt, and General Clinton, newly arived with 400 reinforcements from Boston, would swing south and assault the redoubt from the south and rear.

Under the cover of his artillery, now equipped with the correct ammunition, the British moved forward, assaulting the entire American line. The fleche and breastworks were pounded savagely and gave way. With Starks' and Knowlton's men pinned down, the British were able to move south and attack the redoubt from three sides. Low on water, powder and shot to begin with, Colonel Prescott's men in the redoubt soon ran out of ammunition and the redoubt was breached. The Americans, largely without bayonets, were no match for the charging British Infantry, and retreated.

The British pursued the withdrawing Americans to Bunker's Hill, which they fortified. Later in the battle, as the rebels were forced from the hill, Stark directed the New Hampshire regiment's fire to provide cover for Colonel Prescott's retreating troops. The day's New Hampshire dead were later buried in the central burying ground, Medford, Massachusetts.

## Aftermath


While the British did eventually take the hill that day, their losses were so great (especially among the officers) that they could not hold the positions. This allowed General George Washington, who arrived in Boston two weeks after the battle, to place his cannon on Bunker Hill and Dorchester Heights. This placement threatened the British fleet in Boston Harbor and forced General Gage to withdraw all his forces from the Boston garrison and sail south.
