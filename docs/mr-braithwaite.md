# Mr Braithwaite

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

**Harold Braithwaite** is an English exile in the [Hanover](/hanover) court of Electress [Sophie](/sophie) and her son, Elector George (later [George I](/george-i)). His wife [Henrietta Braithwaite](/henrietta-braithwaite) is one of Princess [Caroline of Ansbach](/caroline-of-ansbach)'s maids and her husband George Augustus's (later [George II](/george-ii)) mistress.
Braithwaite turns later to be a [Jacobite](/jacobite) spy.
*At the moment he was seated in a rather typical Victorian parlor, sipping tea from [a Royal Albert china cup decorated with a rather agnostic briar rose pattern](/stephenson-neal-cryptonomicon-566-lavender-rose-alan-sinder). He looked fidgety; he'd been kept waiting for half an hour, which was also part of the scenario. . . .
   Nell heard the sound of a door opening. Switching to a different angle she saw a parlormaid entering the room. . . . The woman was Chinese, but she played the role with the mid-Atlantic currently in vogue among neo-Victorians: "Mrs. Braithwaite will see you now."
   The client stepped into an adjoining drawing room, where two women awaited him: a heavy Anglo in late middle age and a very attractive Eurasian woman, about thirty. Introductions were performed: The old woman was Mrs. Braithwaite, and the younger woman was her daughter. Mrs. was somewhat addled, and Miss was obviously running the show.
   This section of the script never changed, and Nell had been over it a hundred times trying to troubleshoot it. The client went through a little speech in which he informed Mrs. Braithwaite that her son Richard had been killed in action, displaying great heroism in the process, and that he was recommending him for a posthumous Victoria Cross.

—Nell goes to Madame Ping's Theatre; rumors of the Fists; an important client; . . .*
