*We're given strong hints that **the stone** is in [Enoch Root](/enoch-root)'s possession. Oddly enough, it may explain Enoch's breathe seeming to be metallic to [Jack Shaftoe](/jack-shaftoe). Among its' alias are **Elixer of Life** and **Medicine of Metals**. This **may** be possibly maybe a nudge-nudge wink wink reference to **the Seed** in [The Diamond Age](/the-diamond-age): 
     *[...]this cause, or principle, or whatever one wants to call it, is known as the [Philosopher's Stone](/), or other terms such as the [Philosophic Mercury](/quicksilver), the Vital Agent, The Latent or Subtile Spirit, **the Secret Fire**, the Material Soul of Matter, the Invisible Inhabitant, the Body of Light, **the [Seed](/seed)**, the Seminal Virtue."*
     *"You are confusing a number of different ideas," said [Isaac](/isaac-newton),[...]*
Is it also a refrence to Gandalf? Gandalf to the Balrog - The Fellowship of the Ring:
     " 'You cannot pass,' he said. The orcs stood still and a silence fell. 'I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the Flame of Anor. You cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun. Go back to the Shadow. You cannot pass!' "
It is highly unlikely that, given that Daniel Waterhouse is a Natural Philosopher, his difficulties in living with and then getting his stone (or "calculus") out into the light of day are coincidental.*

**alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan,  
from a 15th c. European portrait of "Geber", Codici Ashburnhamiani 1166  
Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana, Florence, public domain.**
**Jabir Ibn Hayyan** , full name *Abu Musa Jabir Ibn Hayyan Al-Azdi* (أبو موسى جابر بن حيان الأزدي), born c. 721 in Tus (Iran), died c. 815 in Kufah (Iraq). 
Referred as to in Western contexts by the [Latinized](/) form of his given name (Jabir), **Geber**, also known as "the father of Chemistry", because he was the first to scientifically systemize chemistry.

Jabir was born in the year 721 CE as the son of a druggist of the famous [Arab](/)-[Yemeni](/) tribe of [Azd](/).
He later became the pupil of the celebrated Islamic teacher Imam Jaffar. 
He spent most of his life in Kufa, Iraq. In spite of Jabir's leanings toward mysticism and superstition, he more clearly recognized and proclaimed the importance of experimentation. 

"The first essential in chemistry," he declared, "is that you should perform practical work and conduct experiments, for he who performs not practical work nor makes experiments will never attain the least degree of mastery." He made noteworthy advances in both the theory and practice of chemistry.

His books strongly influenced European alchemists and justified their search for the [philosopher's stone](/philosopher-s-stone). He is credited with the invention of many types of now-basic chemical laboratory equipment, and with the discovery and description of many now-commonplace chemical substances and processes — such as the [hydrochloric](/) and [nitric](/) [acids](/), [distillation](/), and [crystallization](/) — that have become the foundation of today's [chemistry](/) and [chemical engineering](/). He was a prominent student of [Jafar Sadiq](/).

**Jabir Ibn Hayyan** and **Geber** were also pen names of an anonymous [14th century](/) European alchemist, author of the treatise *Summa Perfectione* and several other books: see [Pseudo-Geber](/).

## Contributions to chemistry


Jabir wrote more than one hundred treatises on various subjects, of which 22 are about [alchemy](/alchemy). Firmly grounded on experimental observation, his books systematized the knowledge about the fundamental chemical processes of the alchemists — such as crystallization, distillation, [calcination](/), [sublimation](/) and [evaporation](/) — thus making a great step in the evolution of chemistry from an occultist art to a scientific discipline. In particular, Jabir emphasized that definite quantities of various substances are involved in a chemical reaction, thus anticipating by almost a thousand years the principles of quantitative chemistry and the law of constant proportions. 

Jabir is also credited with the invention and development of several chemical instruments that are still used today, such as the [alembic](/), which made distillation easy, safe, and efficient. By distilling various salts together with [sulfuric acid](/), Jabir discovered hydrochloric acid (from [salt](/)) and nitric acid (from [sodium nitrate|saltpeter](/)). By combining the two, he invented [aqua regia](/), one of the few substances that can dissolve [gold](/). Besides its obvious applications to gold extraction and purification, this discovery would fuel the dreams and despair of alchemists for the next thousand years. He is also credited with the discovery of [citric acid](/) (the sour principle of [lemons](/) and other unripe fruits), [acetic acid](/) (from vinegar), and [tartaric acid](/) (from wine-making residues).

Jabir applied his chemical knowledge to the improvement of many manufacturing processes, such as the making of [steel](/wootz-steel) and other metals, [rust](/) prevention, gold lettering, cloth dyeing and waterproofing, [[Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:6:bits of slaughtered animals(Alan Sinder)|leather tanning, and the chemical analysis of pigments and other substances. He developed the use of [manganese dioxide](/) in glassmaking, to counteract the green tinge produced by [iron](/) — a process that is still used to this day. He noted that boiling [wine](/) released a flammable vapor, thus paving the way to [Al-Razi](/)'s discovery of [ethanol](/).

The seeds of the modern classification of elements into metals and non-metals could be seen in his chemical nomenclature. He proposed three categories: "spirits" which vaporize on heating, like [camphor](/), [arsenic](/) and [ammonium chloride](/); "metals", like gold, [silver](/), lead, [copper](/), iron; and "stones" that can be converted into powders. 

In the [Middle Ages](/), Jabir's treatises on chemistry were translated into Latin and became standard texts for [European](/) alchemists. These include the *Kitab al-Kimya* (titled "Book of the Composition of Alchemy" in Europe), translated by [Robert of Chester](/) ([1144](/)); and the *Kitab al-Sab'een* by [Gerard of Cremona](/) (before [1187](/)). [Berthelot](/) translated some his books known by the titles "Book of Kingdom", "Book of the Balances," "Book of Eastern Mercury," and it is obvious that he did not use correct titles for Jabir's books. Several technical terms introduced by Jabir, such as alkali, have found their way into various European languages and have become part of scientific vocabulary. 

Jabir also made important contributions to medicine, astronomy, and other sciences. Unfortunately, only a few of his books have been edited and published, and fewer still are available in translation.

## Contributions to alchemy


Jabir states in his *[Book of Stones](/)* (4:12) that "The purpose is to baffle and lead into error everyone except those whom God loves and provides for!" His works were deliberately written in highly esoteric code, so that only those who had been initiated into his alchemical school could understand them. It is therefore difficult at best for the modern reader to discern which aspects of Jabir's work are to be read as symbols (and what those symbols mean), and what is to be taken literally. Because his works rarely made sense, the term *gibberish* originally referred to his writings. (Hauck, p. 19)

Jabir's alchemical investigations revolved around the ultimate goal of *[takwin](/)* — the artificial creation of life. Jabir's alchemical investigations were theoretically grounded in an elaborate [numerology](/) related to [Pythagorean](/) and [Neoplatonic](/) systems. The nature and properties of elements was defined through numeric values assigned the [Arabic](/) consonants present in their name, ultimately culminating in the number 17.

### [Wikipedia: Philosopher's Stone](/)


The **philosopher's stone**, a longtime "[Holy Grail](/)" of [Western](/) [alchemy](/alchemy), is a [mythical](/) substance that supposedly could turn inexpensive [metals](/) into [gold](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-11-gold-knows-alan-sinder) and/or create an [elixir](/) that would make [humans](/) [immortal](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-20-ask-your-father-alan-sinder). 

#### The stone in [alchemy](/alchemy)


The concept apparently originated from the theories of the [8th century](/) [Islamic](/islam) alchemist [Geber](/). He analyzed each [Aristotelian](/) [element](/) in terms of four basic qualities of *hotness*, *coldness*, *dryness*, and *moistness*. Thus, fire was both hot and dry, earth cold and dry, water cold and moist, and air hot and moist. He further theorized that every metal was a combination of these four principles, two of them interior and two exterior. 

From this premise, it was reasoned that the [transmutation](/) of one metal into another could be effected by the rearrangement of its basic qualities. This change would presumably be mediated by a substance which they called *al-iksir* in [Arabic](/) (from which comes the Western term "elixir"). It was often imagined as a dry powder, made from a mythical stone - the philosopher's stone. The stone was believed to have been composed of a substance called carmot.

#### Claims and frauds


The concept of a substance that could turn cheap metals into valuable gold naturally attracted the attention of many entrepreneurs of all sorts — learned and amateurish, skeptical and gullible, honest and dishonest. An example that illustrates the spirit of the times is that of [Rudolf II](/) (1552-1612). This king of [Bohemia](/) (present-day [Czech Republic](/)), having found himself in financial difficulties, decided to invest heavily in the search for the philosopher's stone. He thus attracted to [Prague](/) a large number of alchemists, who were given ample material and financial support, and promised rewards if they could solve the problem. This "virtual gold rush" may have involved even the Danish astronomer [Tycho Brahe](/tycho-brahe), then at Rudolf's court, who had an alchemical lab built on the grounds of his observatory.

Rudolf never saw his dream realized, and he eventually became insane and had to be deposed by his relatives. It is not known whether his insanity was due to natural causes, or to misuse of alchemical remedies — which often included [toxic](/) metals like [lead](/), [mercury](/), [arsenic](/), and [antimony](/).

### Edward Kelley


Among those who took Rudolf's offer were the English scholar [John Dee](/), and his assistant [Edward Kelley](/), one of the many alchemists who have claimed possession of the philosopher's stone.

Specifically, Kelley claimed that he had acquired in England small amounts of two powders, one white and one red, which had allegedly been found in [Wales](/), in the raided tomb of a [Bishop](/). From these two powders, Kelley would prepare a red "tincture", one drop of which could turn a larger quantity of heated [mercury](/) into gold. There are reports that he performed this feat several times, once even in the presence of Rudolf's court officials, and the gold was later tested and found to be genuine. He is also reported as sending to queen [Elizabeth I of England](/elizabeth-i-of-england) a copper [bed warmer](/) which had been partly transmuted into gold.

Kelley also carried with him a cryptic [manuscript](/), which he claimed had been found with the powders, and which presumably held the secret of their manufacture. On the basis of these claims, Kelley obtained much support from Rudolf — so much so that, when Dee broke with him and returned to England, Kelley chose to remain in Prague. However, Kelley eventually ran out of his magic powders, was jailed by Rudolf in a tower of his castle, and died of injuries sustained in a [rocambolesque](/) escape attempt.

The nature of Kelley's powders is open to conjecture. Gold can be dissolved by [aqua regia](/) to give a red-colored [chloride](/), from which the metal can be easily recovered by heat or simple chemical means. Although that salt has a tendency to decompose on its own, it seems at least possible that Kelley simply plated a layer of gold on some other metal (possibly dissolved in the mercury to form an [amalgam](/)) and then used sleight-of-hand or bribery to pass the goldsmith's test.

## Modern views


Though the notion of a simple philosopher's stone of the alchemic sense fell out of scientific conception by at least the 19th century, its metaphors and imagery persisted: man's attempt to discover the essential secret of the universe, redemptively transforming not just lead into gold, but death into life. In [1901](/), [Ernest Rutherford](/) and [Frederick Soddy](/) discovered that [radioactivity](/) was a sign of fundamental changes within elements, and it was Soddy who quickly made the connection between this and the ancient search for the philosopher's stone (Soddy had studied alchemy extensively as a hobby). At the moment of realization that their radioactive [thorium](/) was converting itself into [radium](/), bit by bit, Soddy later recalled that he shouted out: "Rutherford, this is transmutation!" Rutherford snapped back, "For Mike's sake, Soddy, don't call it *transmutation*. They'll have our heads off as alchemists." However the term stuck, in part because it drew the new discoveries in [nuclear physics](/) into a longer cultural and mystical web. When it was discovered that radioactivity was also tapping into a latent source of energy bound inside atoms, this furthered the thought that [radioactive decay](/) might be the ultimate philosopher's stone. Later, the discovery of [nuclear fission](/) would become consciously connected into the same narrative, especially with optimistic hopes of energy "too cheap to meter" and great utopian cities of the future run on [nuclear energy](/). 

Within the [philosophical](/) system of Western alchemy ([hermeticism](/)), metal transmutations and the philosopher's stone could also be [symbols](/) for inner spiritual transformation of the alchemist. Thus, in religious contexts such as the [New Age](/) movements, the concept may be as valid as it ever was.

## The stone in fiction


The philosopher's stone has appeared in several works of , such as:

* [Hans Christian Andersen](/), *[Philosopher's Stone](/)*.
* [Carl Barks](/)'s [Donald Duck](/) [comic](/) story *[The Fabulous Philosopher's Stone|](/)* . Walt Disney (1955), 24pp. Story code W US 10-02.
* [Max McCoy](/), .
* [J. K. Rowling](/)'s novel *[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone](/)* (1997) and its [movie version](/) (2001); retitled *Sorcerer's Stone* in the [US](/).
* Computer game [World of Warcraft](/), where an Alchemist uses the Stone as a mediating component in transmuting metals and elemental materials.
* Japanese television animation series [Fullmetal Alchemist](/) (2003).
* In video game [Valkyrie Profile](/) Lezard Valeth has possession of the Philosopher's Stone, refering to it as "the ten-billion-page codex."
