### [Wikipedia:God](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-god) excerpt


**God**, the name given in English to the one supreme being, as postulated, especially but not exclusively, by the three major Abrahamic religions ([Judaism](/judaism), [Christianity](/christianity), and [Islam](/islam)) as well as Hinduism (Brahman), Sikhism and Zoroastrianism. When spelled with a small "g" it is a common noun, referring to one of the postulated supernatural beings of some religious systems, such as the gods of the Greek and Roman religions.

See [Deities](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-deities) for a list from various religions. See also [Goddess](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-goddess).

It can also be used to refer to similar concepts such as an energy or consciousness that pervade the universe, and whose existence makes the universe possible; the source of all existence ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YHWH YHWH); the best and highest good within all sentient beings; a higher power; or even that which is beyond all understanding or definition.

Conflicting interpretations arise regarding the name of "God", and what the name actually meansoften the infinite God concept is mixed with non-infinite personifications of "God" (i.e., God as an old man, a Zeus or Odin.) A belief in a "God" or gods is found in all cultures, although followers of a particular God or gods may consider other gods to be nonexistent or inferior. Likewise many people hold non-literal, sometimes even secular interpretations of God; few of which contradict the concept of the "Absolute Infinite", despite any contradictions they may have with any particular religious tradition.
