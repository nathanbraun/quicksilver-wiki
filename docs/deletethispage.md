## What is this page?



This page is a pointer to mark pages that have been deleted.

## Why has the page been deleted?



When the page starts with a link to *DeleteThisPage*, it is considered "marked for deletion", and eventually a user with administrator will delete the page. Pages are marked for deletion when they are spam, if they are obviously a test page, or off-topic. If you believe that a page has been erroneously marked for deletion, simply remove the tag and possibly change the page such that it is more obvious why it is on-topic.

## How can I find all pages that have been marked for deletion?



Click the [What links here](/http-www-metaweb-com-wiki-wiki-phtml-title-special-whatlinkshere-target-deletethispage) link in the toolbar on the left to find all pages that have been marked for deletion.
