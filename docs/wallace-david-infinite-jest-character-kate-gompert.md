From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

From 26 April 1996:

| 7) What happened to Kate Gompert? Did she end up as a subject of the AFR's "digital" experiment like Lenz? Was something mentioned on this somewhere?

I'm pretty sure she did. Let's see... on p. 782 Marathe invites her to
look at the Entertainment. I just did a quick scan to look for a
subsequent mention of her and I don't find it, but I remember a
paragraph somewhere about the results of their experiments. It may
have mentioned only Lenz and Poor Tony though.
