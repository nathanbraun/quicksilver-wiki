*[Cryptonomicon](/cryptonomicon)'s WWII hero code cracker [Lawrence Waterhouse](/lawrence-waterhouse) is informed - **A photograph of the king hangs on the wall behind the desk. Waterhouse hadn't known, until Colonel Chattan discreetly reminded him, that His Majesty's full title was not simply By the Grace Of God of England King, but B.T.G.O.G. of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man, Guernsey, Jersey, Outer Qwghlm, and Inner Qwghlm King.***

### Inner Qwghlm


*Inner Qwghlm is hardly even an island; it is joined to the main land by a sandbar that used to come and go with the tides, but that has been beefed up with a causeway that carries a road and the railway line. ...* And then there's *the* statue   *where a scrawny, downtrodden loser* (identified as an Inner Qwghlmian), enslaved with a collar and chain, eternally whimpers at *the strapping Qwghlmian he-men*'s carnage. The best way to get a grip on the Inner/Outer interaction is to go to Church with them in Australia as discussed in in [Cryptonomicon](/cryptonomicon)'s Chapter 64  **Organ**.
This eventually ties in to how [Mary](/mary-ccmndhd) represents GOD's love for Lawrence. And when to use a **[Galvanick Lucipher](/galvanick-lucipher)** to light a dark corner.
