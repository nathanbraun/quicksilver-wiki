From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

"Ractive" from InteRACTIVE. Also, Ractor.

A type of futuristic dramatic presentation blending a play with a movie with a video game.

End-users place "bids" to act with professional ractors in a given scenario, or a scene from a well-known play or movie. These can last minutes or hours depending. All the "action" takes place on the (diamond) screen of a "mediatron", which is like a highly-evolved internet.

Ractors are people who have gone to the expense and trouble of having a type of grid implanted into their bodies which is then read by sensors which convert those grid-points into a simulated character, then displayed on a mediatron. 

These ractives seem used mostly as a form of interactive t.v., but retain some elements of a chat room, for example (sexual encounters seem likely), and hold promise of using more like arcade game in the sense of fantasy escape.
