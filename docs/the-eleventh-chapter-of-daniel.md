# The eleventh chapter of Daniel

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

 The Opening of Eleventh Sephira 

1. Passing too many gates
2. leaving too many graves behind
3. follow Jupiter's son on his way to hell
4. the pilgrimage of lost hopes
5. I kissed the bishop's poisonous ring
6. I was dead between the dead
7. White pages of your holy books
8. torn to pieces by my hands
9. the sword is too heavy
10. the shield far too small
11. Are we the tribe of kings
12. yet destined to fall?
13. Silver dawn awakening
14. so far, far away from home
15. the journey starts when I open my mouth
16. swallowing careless words
17. For the truth is not far beyond the veil of stars
18. you won't find anything on
19. the bottom of darkness
20. it's all in the serpent's lethal bite
21. it's in these little charming moments of thrill
22. and we are not who we think we are
23. we are who we're afraid to be


1. Addei Nam Namppa Khadu
2. Tah O'Khadu Hallei
3. Iah! Iah! Goadii Mazzu
4. Halle-lei Badu Zarrah
