# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:398:...Frenchman wears those sabots (Professorbikeybike)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

**Note:** this isn't the first appearence of the term *sabot*.

A bit of etymology:

While a *sabot* is merely a wooden shoe, to *sabotage* something is quite different. "The word is said to date from a French railway strike of 1910 when workers destroyed the wooden shoes (sabots) that held the rails in place" ([http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?eu=66308&tocid=0&query=sabotage&ct=)](/http-www-britannica-com-eb-article-eu-66308-tocid-0-query-sabotage-ct).
The story that the word sabotage originally referred to damage done to machinery by [sabots](/sabot) is not believed to be true.

**Another note:** N. Stephenson however uses the latter explanation of the word in this [little bit of etymology on p. 444](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-444-sabotage-david-c-weichert).
