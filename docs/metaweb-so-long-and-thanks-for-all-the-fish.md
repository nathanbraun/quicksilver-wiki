# Metaweb:So long, and thanks for all the fish

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

A few years ago, Applied Minds created this site with [Neal Stephenson](/user-neal-stephenson) to make a collaboratively edited collection of annotations,
initially for Neal's book Quicksilver, and later, for other works as
well. We called this site "The Quicksilver Metaweb."

More recently, I and my co-workers at Applied Minds have begun a
project called "The Metaweb" which bears little resemblance to this
site. Applied Minds will soon remove the link from metaweb.com's front
page to here. If you wish to reach this site, you will need to use the
URL [www.metaweb.com/wiki/wiki.phtml?title=Main\_Page](/http-www-metaweb-com-wiki-wiki-phtml-title-main-page).

It's a fair guess that Applied Minds may take this site down in the
future. The content here is licensed under the GNU FDL, so you are
welcome to save it, archive it, and make it available to others using
the same license. You may wish to use [this discussion page](/metaweb-talk-so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish) to share techniques for copying this site (me, I like wget).

I want to thank all of the contributors who have helped to make this
site. Neal Stephenson, for contributing his time and annotations, Neal's
publisher, for supporting our efforts, [Darin Wilson](/user-darin) for setting up
MediaWiki, [Tomi Pierce](/user-tpierce), who made sure this project happened, Ken
Skistimas, who improved the MediaWiki site layout, [Blair Zajac](/user-blair), for
doing much of the site administration in the early days, [Jeremy
Bornstein](user-jeremybornstein), for his thoughts and annotations, and Robert Cook and Danny
Hillis, for their encouragement.

Finally, I would like to thank all of the current active users who
have created entries, built links, and stepped up to do the day to day
maintenance that comes with a user-editable site. This site could not
have happened without your efforts.
