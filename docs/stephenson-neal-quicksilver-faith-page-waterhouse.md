### Faith Waterhouse


**Faith Waterhouse** is the owner of the "silver caduceus" [Uncle Ham](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-mayflower-waterhouse-ham) gave her husband-to-be [Daniel](/daniel-waterhouse) when he was most likely her age. She is the mother of [Godfrey](/godfrey-waterhouse). She seems taken both by the concept of "[Free Will](/free-will)" and the young handsome proponent of it in [Boston](/boston).

She uses [Mother Goose](/mother-goose) as a nanny rather than a [slave](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-13-some-irish-the-rest-angolan-alan-sinder).

* Faith means - The theological virtue defined as secure belief in God and a trusting acceptance of God's will.
* One meaning of water is "A level of excellence." And house - The sign of the zodiac indicating the seat or station of a planet in the heavens. And relates to **[Enki](/me)** and **[me](/minerva)**.
* Silver as a commodity or medium of exchange.
* the [caduceus](/caduceus) was the magic staff of [Hermes](/hermes-myth) ([Mercury](/quicksilver-or-mercury)), the god of commerce, eloquence, invention, travel and theft, and so was a symbol of heralds and commerce, not medicine. The words caduity & caducous imply temporality, perishableness and senility, while the medical profession espouses renewal, vitality and health; Mercury, a Roman Christian (Rom. 16:14)
