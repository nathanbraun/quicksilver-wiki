History

In the Middle Ages, most of the area of the current province was ruled by the bishop of Utrecht. The bishopric was founded in 722 by Willibrord. Many wars were fought between Utrecht and the neighbouring counties and duchies, Holland, Gelderland and Brabant. 

In 1527, the bishop of Utrecht sold his worldly power over his territories to Emperor Charles V, who already owned the other Dutch provinces. However, the Habsburg rule did not last long, as Utrecht joined the revolt of the United Provinces against Charles' son Philip II of Spain in 1579. 

In 1713, the Spanish Netherlands became the Austrian Netherlands, and Austria also received Naples and Milan.
