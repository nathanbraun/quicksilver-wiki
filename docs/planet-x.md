 Planet X 

As yet undiscovered tenth planet of our solar system. Whether the hypothesized and occasionally observed but never confirmed planet [Vulcan](/vulcan) inside the orbit of [Mercury](/mercury), or the largest asteroid, [Ceres](/ceres), or some very large [Kuiper Belt Object](/), current astronomers can't even seem to decide if we have a ninth planet yet, as dispute has arisen, now that more KBOs are being discovered, as to whether the planet [Pluto](/pluto) is actually a planet, or just a very very very large comet.
