The Goombata Bank is where citizens of Novo Sicilia keep their Goombata Bucks, earned for work on behalf of la familia in one of their industries or other activities. Goombata Bucks are a secure private currency, which excludes its earners from paying income tax to Fedworld on said earnings (though Mafia, Inc. may want its vig).
