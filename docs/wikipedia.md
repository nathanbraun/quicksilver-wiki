**Wikipedia** is often compared to [Metaweb:An explanation of the similarities and differences between Wikipedia and Metaweb](/metaweb-an-explanation-of-the-similarities-and-differences-between-wikipedia-and-metaweb) clarifies these.

[http://wikipedia.org](/http-wikipedia-org)

The most obvious similarity is its reliance on the [MediaWiki](/mediawiki) software which was originally developed for Wikipedia. Other projects, like [Disinfopedia](/disinfopedia) and [Consumerium](/consumerium), use both this software and the [GNU FDL](/gnu-fdl) license without [Invariant Sections](/invariant-section) (so far), so that copying text back and forth from any of these projects is a cut and paste with no legal ramifications. Nice for us.

Because of its huge volume, over 300,000 articles in 22 languages compiled by thousands of users since January 2001, and its plans to distribute static CD versions, the standards set by Wikipedia will likely be a weighty influence on any future [wikitext standard](/wikitext-standard). Most likely, it will set that standard since no other project will be able to claim to have worked out the details of so much complex presentation of information and such a wide base of end users with no particular background, in so many languages. It has set many precedents for the [GFDL text corpus](/gfdl-text-corpus).

[Metaweb:governance ideas](/metaweb-governance-ideas) will also likely draw on Wikipedia's experiences, good and bad. Wikipedia in fact devotes a whole site just to discuss it's many issues and problems, [http://meta.wikipedia.org](/http-meta-wikipedia-org) - this is well worth some visits to see just how complex the problems of large [wiki management](/wiki-management) problems can really become.

*There is no real agreement on best practices, see [http://meta.wikipedia.org/wiki/faction](/http-meta-wikipedia-org-wiki-faction) for a list of various ways to discuss it and what issues are considered important by different groups and what "factions" have formed. See [Metaweb:faction](/metaweb-faction) for some discussion of how to deal with similar issues here, and [phyle](/phyle) for [Stephensonia](/stephensonia) on how to do so.*
