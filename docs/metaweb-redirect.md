## What do we use redirects for?


* Abbreviations: [DSM-IV](/dsm-iv) redirects to [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders](/diagnostic-and-statistical-manual-of-mental-disorders)

* Alternate capitalisations: [Natural Selection](/natural-selection) redirects to [Natural selection](/natural-selection)
* Alternate languages: [Die Entführung aus dem Serail](/die-entführung-aus-dem-serail) redirects to [The Abduction from the Seraglio](/the-abduction-from-the-seraglio)

* Accents: [Kurt Goedel](/kurt-goedel) and [Kurt Godel](/kurt-godel) redirect to [Kurt Gödel](/kurt-gödel)
* Sub-topics: [Distributed denial of service](/distributed-denial-of-service) redirects to [Denial of service](/denial-of-service)
* Facilitate disambiguation: [America (disambiguation)](/america-disambiguation) redirects to [America](/america)
* Avoiding broken links (see below)


Sub-topic redirects are often temporary, eventually being replaced by fully fledged articles on the sub-topic in question. Be conservative when creating sub-topic redirects - they can sometimes be counter-productive, because they disguise the absence of a proper article from editors. Sub-topic redirects should only be used where the main article has a section on the sub-topic. For example, [denial of service](/denial-of-service) has a section on distributed denial of service.

In accordance with [wikipedia:naming conventions (precision)](/wikipedia-naming-conventions-precision) it's best to have an article at a well-defined, unambiguous term, with redirects from looser colloquial terms, rather than vice versa.


### Renamings and merges


We try to avoid broken links, because they annoy visitors. Therefore, if we change the layout of some section of Wikipedia, or we merge two [duplicate articles](/wikipedia-duplicate-articles), we always leave redirects in the old location to point to the new location. Search engines and visitors will probably have linked to *that* page at *that* url. If the page is deleted, potential new visitors from search engines will be greeted with an edit window. The same is true for anyone who previously bookmarked *that* page, and so on. 

On a small scale, this applies to cases where we had [duplicate articles](/wikipedia-duplicate-articles) on some subject, or lots of twisty little stubs on different aspects of the same overall subject. On a larger scale, we've had a few fairly major reorganisations:

* Moving away from [CamelCase](/camelcase) article names
* Moving away from having homepages in the article namespace (see [User:Tim Starling/Redirects from : to User:](/user-tim-starling-redirects-from-to-user) for a partial list)
* Moving away from using [subpages](/wikipedia-subpages) in the article namespace



## When should we delete a redirect?


To delete a redirect **without replacing it with a new article**, list it on [redirects for deletion](/wikipedia-redirects-for-deletion). See [deletion policy](/wikipedia-deletion-policy) for details on how to nominate pages for deletion.

This isn't necessary if you just want to replace a redirect with an article: see [meta:redirect](/) for instructions on how to do this.

You might want to delete a redirect if one or more of the following conditions is met:
1. The redirect page makes it *unreasonably* difficult for users to locate similarly named articles via the search engine. (see [meta:searches and redirects](/) for proposals to lessen this impact)
2. The redirect might cause confusion. For example, "Charles C. Boyer" used to redirect to "Daniel C. Boyer", because Daniel was accidentally called Charles on one external web page. However, this caused confusion with the article on [Charles Boyer](/charles-boyer), so it was deleted.
3. The redirect is offensive, such as "Joe Bloggs is a Loser" to "Joe Bloggs".
4. The redirect makes no sense, such as [[Pink elephants painting daisies]] to [love](/love)


However, avoid deleting such redirects if:
1. They have a potentially useful page history. If the redirect was created by renaming a page with that name, and the page history just mentions the renaming, and for one of the reasons above you want to delete the page, copy the page history to the Talk page of the article it redirects to. The act of renaming is useful page history, and even more so if there has been discussion on the page name.
2. They would aid [accidental linking](/meatball-accidentallinking).
3. They would make the creation of [duplicate articles](/wikipedia-duplicate-articles) less likely.
4. They aid searches on certain terms.
5. Someone finds them useful. Hint: If someone says they find a redirect useful, they probably do. You might not find it useful - this is not because the other person is a liar, but because you browse Wikipedia in different ways.


For example, redirecting [Dubya](/dubya) to [George W. Bush](/george-w-bush) might be considered offensive, but the redirect aids accidental linking, makes the creation of duplicate articles less likely, and is useful to some people, so it should not be deleted.


## What needs to be done on pages that are targets of redirects?


We follow the "[principle of least astonishment](/principle-of-least-astonishment)" - after following a redirect, the readers's first question is likely to be: "hang on ... I wanted to read about *this*. Why has the link taken me to *that*?". Make it clear to the reader that they *have* arrived in the right place.

Normally, we try to make sure that all "inbound redirects" are mentioned in the first couple of paragraphs of the article. For example:

* **Longships** were boats used by the Vikings...
	+ [longship](/longship), redirect from [viking ship](/viking-ship)
* **Mario Party** is a video game series...
	+ [Mario Party](/mario-party), redirect from [Mario Party 2](/mario-party-2)
* **Edvard Munch** ([1863](/1863) - [1944](/1944)) was ... The broadest collection of his works is at on display at the Munch Museum at...
	+ [Edvard Munch](/edvard-munch), redirect from [Munch Museum](/munch-museum)



## Self-links, duplicate links


Avoid self-links, including self-links through redirects ("loop links"). Also, avoid having two links that go to the same place. These can confuse readers, and cause them to unnecessarily load the same page twice.


### Double redirects


See [Wikipedia:Defective redirects](/wikipedia-defective-redirects) for an auto-generated list of double redirects on the English Wikipedia
