From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

James Orin Incandenza, aka JOI or "Himself," an allusion to his appearance in film credits under this title. 

The "only child of a former top U.S. jr. tennis player and then promising young pre-Method actor." p. 63. The father is the subject of two of IJ's fascinating character studies about fathers and sons, on p. 157 and p. 491.

Founder of Enfield Tennis Academy, "a U.S.T.A.-accredited and pedagogically experimental tennis academy," p. 64, eight years before Subsidized Time. p. 63. As a junior tennis champion, JOI was "tall, bespectacled, domineering at net - who used tennis scholarships to finance, on his own, private secondary and then higher education" p. 63.

Worked "during the Federal interval G. Ford - early G. Bush" as an optical scientist, p. 63, then took early retirement from the public sector, p. 64, and made his fortune in a variety of practical consumer applications of optical technology. p. 64. 

As a "tall, ungainly, socially challenged and hard-drinking" man, p. 64, JOI married Avril Mondragon. They met "at a U. Toronto conference on Reflective vs. Reflexive Systems," p. 64. Father of [Wallace:David:Infinite\_Jest:Character:Orin Incandenza](/wallace-david-infinite-jest-character-orin-incandenza), [Wallace:David:Infinite\_Jest:Character:Hal Incandenza](/wallace-david-infinite-jest-character-hal-incandenza), and perhaps [Wallace:David:Infinite\_Jest:Character:Mario Incandenza](/wallace-david-infinite-jest-character-mario-incandenza).

JOI's work as a filmmaker was "experimental- and conceptual-film work too far either ahead of or behind its time, possibly, to be much appreciated at the time of his death," p. 64.

Suicide in the Year of the Trial-Sized Dove Bar, at the age of 54. p. 64. Commemmorations and memorials included a planned festschrift from Cornell University Press, a classified email from President Gentle, and an assortment of "certain oblique visual gestures" from various filmmakers that year (all p. 65).

JOI is buried "in Quebec's L'Islet County" and that his burial "was twice delayed by annular hyperfloration cycles," p. 65, which implies that his grave is inside the Concavity.
