*As I could never [grok](/grok) why [Stan Lee](/) had his version of [Thor](/) speak in a psuedo-Elizabethan English manner  I thought there was something odd about Mister Clarke the Apothecary having to get in line as they say in [New York](/). Makes you wonder - eh?*

#### INTRANSITIVE VERB:

#### ETYMOLOGY:

 
French, from Old French cue , tail, from Latin *cauda*, *coda*. 

***Coda*** (Italian for "tail"; from the Latin cauda), in music, a term for a passage which brings a movement or a separate piece to a conclusion. This developed from the simple chords of a cadence into an elaborate and independent form. In a series of variations on a theme or in a composition with a fixed order of subjects, the coda is a passage sufficiently contrasted with the conclusions of the separate variations or subjects, added to form a complete conclusion to the whole. Beethoven raised the coda to a feature of the highest importance. What is known in popular music as an outro can be considered a coda. 

In music notation, the coda symbol is used as a navigation marker, similarly to the dal Segno sign. It looks like a large O with a + superimposed. 

It is encountered mainly in transcriptions of popular music, and is used where the exit from a repeated section is within that section rather than at the end. The instruction "To Coda" indicated that the performer is to jump to the separate section headed with the symbol. 

#### WORD HISTORY:


When the British stand in *queues* (as they have been doing at least since 1837, when this meaning of the word is first recorded in English), they may not realize they form a tail. The French word queue from which the English word is borrowed is a descendant of Latin coda, meaning tail. 

French queue appeared in 1748 in English, referring to a plait of hair hanging down the back of the neck. By 1802 wearing a queue was a regulation in the British army, but by the mid-19th century queues had disappeared along with cocked hats. Latin *coda* is also the source of Italian *coda*, which was adopted into English as a musical term (like so many other English musical terms that come from Italian). A coda is thus literally the tail end of a movement or compositio
