# Metaweb:Vocabulary

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

[Metaweb](/metaweb) hasn't chosen a level of **vocabulary** so by default it is in [Full English](/full-english). A [defining vocabulary](/defining-vocabulary) in English is about 2000 words, and this is typically required to explain [idiom](/idiom), so that would be a bare minimum.

The **junior high school level** (3000-5000 words) has been mentioned (by [Neal](/user-nealstephenson)) as an eventual [reading level](/reading-level) target. See [Simple English Editor role outline at Simple English Wikipedia](/http-simple-wikipedia-org-wiki-simple-english-editor) for a list of what one might need to know before setting a vocabulary level.

If there is to be some intention of reflecting the [Baroque](/baroque) setting of [Quicksilver](/quicksilver), this would suggest [British English](/british-english) spellings as well.

Those spellings are also used in International English.
