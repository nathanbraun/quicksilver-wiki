# Metaweb:Community entry

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

The **community entry** is the section of an [intermediate page](/metaweb-intermediate-page) where anyone can add text about the topic, or edit what is already there.

The community entry should be introduce the topic. It can be brief or it can grow to be an encyclopedic entry. In this text, strive for a neutral point of view. If you want to create an entry from a particular viewpoint, you should put that in a [authored entry](/metaweb-authored-entry) instead.
