# Metaweb:Guide to Layout

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

The **Metaweb Guide to Layout** is an annotated, working example of some of the basics of laying out an article.

For page markup; see [metaweb:How does one edit a page](/metaweb-how-does-one-edit-a-page).
For style guidelines; see [metaweb:Manual of Style](/metaweb-manual-of-style).

This little article is just a summary of what some fairly clean, simple Metaweb articles look like. 
For more complicated articles, you may want to copy the markup of some existing article you like the looks of.

In particular, see the [metaweb:intermediate page](/metaweb-intermediate-page) template for intermediate pages that link together several entries on a topic.

## Introductory material



The subject of the article should be mentioned in '''strongly emphasised''' text at a natural place in the article.
The name of the subject may appear slightly different from the title of the page, or may include variations, but normally it is identical to the page title.

If the article is long enough to contain several paragraphs, then the first paragraph should be short and to the point, with a clear explanation of what subject of the page is.
If further introductory material is needed before the first header, then this can be given in additional paragraphs.

## Lists



Indented lists are:
* good for organizing
	+ neatly
	+ efficiently
* self-formatting


Lists start with a blank line, so put your first list item directly under the introductory phrase.

Unindented lists are good for alphabetic listing of personalities:
 Anne
 John
 Mark
 Sophie

Numbered lists:
1. number automatically
2. make it easy to move items around in a list
3. let you add items between other items


## Structure of the article



Paragraphs should be relatively short, as the eye gets tired of following solid text for too many lines.

Headers also help make an article clearer and determine the table of contents.
Since headers are hierarchical, and some people set their user preferences to number them, you should start with ==Header== and follow it with ===Subheader===, ====Subsubheader====, and so forth.
Yes, the ==Header== is awfully big in some browsers, but that can be fixed in the future with a style sheet more easily than a nonhierarchical article structure can be fixed.

Certain optional standardized sections go at the bottom of the article, as you see below.

## Quotations



Under this header, list any memorable quotations that are appropriate to the subject.
