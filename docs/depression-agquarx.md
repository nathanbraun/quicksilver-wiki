From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

 DEPRESSION 
A state of mind I get after visiting metaweb. I can't do it very often because of it. Why do I return at all? Selfabuse, I guess or masochism or a case of vampire erotica. I also get pissed and want to destroy. I hate to feel like that. How do you do it? Don't tell me, it will spoil the fun.
