# Abbey:Edward:The Monkey Wrench Gang:13:George Washington Hayduke (Professorbikeybike)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Although not confirmed, [Hayduke's](/george-washington-hayduke) name most likely comes from the Serbs who resisted the invading Turks, known as *[haiduks](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-391-haiduks-professorbikeybike)*.

The same word appears in Bulgarian. It has not only a meaning of describing people of armed resistence, another negative meaning is of people that are burglers robbing people on roads crossing forests.

Haiduks were usually strategically positioned in the mountains, maintained support network in a specific area and revenged injustices perpetrated by Turks on local people. They did not have a greater agenda of widely organized fighting for the liberation of the entire territory of Bulgaria (or Serbia, talking about Serbian haiduks).

Possible sentences with this word:
"Haiduks fought the Turks".
"Haiduks killed my horse and stole the cart."
