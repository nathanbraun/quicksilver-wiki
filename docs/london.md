 * ... [Lawrence] Waterhouse found a worm-eaten copy of the Encyclopedia [Qwghlmiana](/qwghlm) in a bookshop near the British Museum a week ago and has been carrying it around in his attache case since then, imbibing a page or two at a time, like doses of strong medicine. The overriding Themes of the Encyclopedia are three, and they dominate its every paragraph as totally as the Three Sgrhs dominate the landscape of [Outer Qwghlm](/outer-qwghlm). Two of these themes are wool and guano, though the Qwghlmians have other names for them, in their ancient, sui generis tongue. In fact, the same linguistic hyperspecialization occurs here that supposedly does with the Eskimos and snow or Arabs and sand, and the Encyclopedia Qwghlmiana never uses the English words "wool" and "guano" except to slander the inferior versions of these products that are exported by places like Scotland in a perfidious effort to confuse the naïve buyers who apparently dominate the world's commodity markets. Waterhouse had to read the encyclopedia almost cover-to-cover and use all his cryptanalytic skills to figure out, by inference, what these products actually were. ...*

#### London's Growth into a Cosmopolitan City in the Baroque Period



![London-1604mw.jpg](/images/London-1604mw.jpg)  
**Jacobean London circa 1604 CE**
London is one of the world's great cities. It was arguably the most important city in the world during the [Baroque](/baroque) period, when English sea power was rising, and, the [Royal Society](/royal-society) was one of the most pre-eminent places to exchange knowledge in Europe.

With Catholic Europe subjecting its best scientist to the Inquisition, it was Protestant countries that needed 'on the edge' advances as soon as possible. Among the [Society](/royal-society-of-london-for-the-improvement-of-natural-knowledge)'s first actions involved trying to improve England's military might focusing on naval cannon. England as a naval power will allow for growth of new disciplines. This leads to places such as the Royal Greenwich Observatory; Flamsteed House (1675-76), the original part of the Observatory, was designed by [Sir Christopher Wren](/christopher-wren) and was the first purpose-built scientific research facility in Britain. *Seems Newton tried to erase [Robert Hooke](/robert-hooke)'s work **here** as well -- many of the Wren buildings were done to Hooke's plans.*

We have to look at the Great Fire of London in 1666, which in the [Quicksilver](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver) universe saw [Charles II](/charles-ii-of-england) kill [Drake Waterhouse](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-drake-waterhouse) with barrels of gunpowder before the eyes of [Daniel](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-daniel-waterhouse). The Great Fire of London was a major fire that swept through the City of London from September 2 -5, 1666, and resulted more or less in its destruction. The fire had the beneficial effect of killing many of the rats which were responsible for the spread of the Great Plague. The fire had a marked and varied impact on English society. See [Charles II](/charles-ii), [Christopher Wren](/christopher-wren), and [Samuel Pepys](/samuel-pepys).

The obvious difference in London was its expansion inside and outside the city. The city was growing at a tremendous speed. Literature and art show us this. Artists such as Wenceslaus Hollar[[1]](/http-www-princeton-edu-his291-jpegs-sprat-jpg), Richard Newcourt and William Faithorne, detailed information on the directions in which London was extending through the mid-seventeenth century. They had the Thames as the major highway between London and Westminster in the 16th and 17th centuries.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, during the period now referred to as the Little Ice Age, the Thames often froze over in the winter. This led to the first "Frost Fair" in 1607, complete with a tent city set up on the river itself and offering a number of odd amusements, including ice bowling.[[2]](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-little-ice-age)

It remained the centre of English-speaking culture until at least the mid [20th century](/20th-century), whereafter some would claim it became one of many great cities of that culture, with only [New York City](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-new-york-city) more important as the *newest unofficial* **International World Capital** housing the headquarters of the **United Nations**. 

However, today, London is the centre of much the world's [insurance](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-insurance) and [brokerage](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-brokerage) businesses, and has a much more international financial character than does New York, which may also be in decline after events of [9-11, 2001](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-september-11-2001-terrorist-attack) and various accounting scandals. 

Contrariwise, the 21st century might well be centered on cities that have the Pacific Ocean in their backyard, and speak Chinese as much as they do English. Perhaps London will be the future Library Depository of the England language in the future.

2. [... What caused the Little Ice Age?](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-little-ice-age) "Scientists have identified two likely suspects: decreased sunspot activity and increased volcanic activity. During the period 1645-1715, right in the middle of the Little Ice Age, solar activity as seen in sunspots was extremely low, with some years having no sunspots at all. This period of low sunspot activity is known as the Maunder Minimum . What the precise link between low sunspot activity and cooling temperatures is has not been established, but scientists say that the coincidence of the Maunder Minimum with the deepest trough of the Little Ice Age is highly suggestive of such a connection. Throughout the Little Ice Age the world also experienced heightened volcanic activity. When a volcano erupts, its ash reaches high into the atmosphere and can spread to cover the whole earth. This ash cloud blocks out some of the incoming solar radiation, leading to world-wide cooling that can last up to two years after an eruption. Also emitted by eruptions is sulfur in the form of SO2gas. When this gas reaches the stratosphere it turns into sulfuric acid particles, which reflect the sun's rays, further reducing the amount of radiation reaching the earth's surface. ... "
