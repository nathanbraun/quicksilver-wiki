# Metaweb:Cool projects (Patrick Tufts)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Metaweb contributor Chris Swingle ([User:Cswingle](/user-cswingle)) has done something particularly neat with the [Quicksilver annotations](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-all-annotations-by-page-number) page. Chris has created a [printable PDF](/http-www-metaweb-com-wiki-upload-0-01-annotations-pdf) of these annotations. The really cool thing is that it's automatically generated from Metaweb content.

To do this, Chris created a script that crawls [Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:All\_annotations\_by\_page\_number](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-all-annotations-by-page-number) and follows the annotation links to grab each annotation's text.

His script then takes this text and reformats it as a Adobe PDF file -- perfect for printing and inserting into your own copy of *Quicksilver.*

In his description of the PDF file, Chris writes:

This is a letterpaper sized PDF version of all annotations by page number for Quicksilver. All content is culled from this site, and formatted using Python and TeX with a script written by cswingle. It is updated frequently, but may be slightly behind what can be found at this site. A datestring near the end of the file identifies when it was created. The TeX source may also become available if people are interested in running their own copies (for different paper sizes, psbook | psnup -2, etc.)

See [Annotations.pdf](/http-www-metaweb-com-wiki-upload-0-01-annotations-pdf) for the latest copy.
