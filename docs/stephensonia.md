# Stephensonia

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

**Stephensonia** is an interim name to stick on a [Metaweb:intermediate page](/metaweb-intermediate-page) when an aspect of an entry is only meaningful in the work of [Neal Stephenson](/user-nealstephenson). *Italics are used also for fictional implications of any kind by any author, but they are also used for so much else that a separate section on* **Stephensonia** seems advisable.
