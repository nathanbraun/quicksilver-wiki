## mediated reality


Mediated reality is an overlay of media upon one's sensory input of reality via technology, either via filtering (earplugs, sunglasses, clothes, perfume, deodorants, etc) or the provisional overlay of additional data that baseline human senses cannot obtain (IR/UV/SONAR/RADAR vision, GPS positioning, exact meteorological data, retinal/RFID/DNA data on surrounding objects or persons, etc).
