From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Jeremy? Please note that the article states: "... The Jewish community in England also changed in the 1700s. It had been primarily **Sephardi** throughout the 1600s, but it became more Ashkenazi in culture as growing numbers of German and Polish Jews arrived. ..."

**âˆ´** Odds are good that we had a Separdic1 Jew prism salesman.
Cromwell's freeing the parishes from a central authority allowed Jews as Jews back into England proper. **Even though the man claimed to be from Poland -- he may not want two feckless youths to know his origins ...**   


[Jewish Encyclopedia](/http-www-jewishencyclopedia-com-index-jsp) - (This website contains the complete contents of the 12-volume Jewish Encyclopedia, which was originally published between 1901-1906. The Jewish Encyclopedia, which recently became part of the public domain, contains over 15,000 articles and illustrations) - is a resource we can use if we stay alert to its limitations.
