**Samuel Morey** (October 23, 1762 - April 17, 1843), American inventor, invented the internal combustion engine and was a pioneer in steamships who accumulated a total of 20 patents.

Born in Hebron, Connecticut, he built his first steamboat in 1792 and was granted several patents related to steam engines and their use on ships. In 1797, he built a steamship with a paddlewheel on each side but did not patent the arrangement. [Robert Fulton](/robert-fulton), the inventor of the first commercially successful steamboat, used a method similar to Morey's, primarily because the investors to whome Morey had previously presented his second, larger, steamship, chose to back Fulton. Morey later confronted Fulton on the deck of Fulton's ship and declared to the public, "That scalawag stole my patent!"

On April 1, 1826, Morey was granted a patent for the internal combustion engine, which would later permit the invention of the automobile in the 1890s. He was granted his last patent at the age of 71 in 1833.

Morey moved to Orford, New Hampshire, with his family in 1768. He later moved to Fairlee, Vermont, but was buried in Orford in 1843. Lake Morey in Vermont is named in his honor.
