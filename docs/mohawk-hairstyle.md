From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

The **Mohawk [hairstyle](/hairstyle)** is traditionally thought to be a hair style worn by the [Mohegan](/mohegan) and [Mohawk tribes](/mohawk-tribe).


## Stephensonia


In [The System of the World](/the-system-of-the-world), young [Whig](/whig) gentlemen sport a Mohawk hairstyle instead of [periwigs](/periwig).

## In reality


In reality it appears that the [Huron](/huron) were the first to sport the Mohawk. Like many indigenous tribes in the [Great Lakes](/great-lakes) region, they wore a type of hair style in which all their hair would be cut off except for a narrow strip down the middle of the scalp. In some cases the hair was left the natural, dark, color at the base and colored from the middle to the top with an orange/yellow fade to look like the sunset. The final product resembles a line of [buffalo](/buffalo) running along the horizon. Today such a hair style is still called a Mohawk, though the hair is often made to point up as spikes.

In [punk](/punk) fashion, the hair is often dyed brilliant colours and the centre strip of hair worn so that it points straight up often to impressive height.

Besides punk fashion, the Mohawk became known with the popularity of [Mr. T](/mr-t), the actor who first became famous playing the boxer Clubber Lang in the movie [Rocky III](/rocky-iii) and later as Sgt. B.A. Baracus in the television series [The A-Team](/the-a-team). Another well-known popular culture depiction of the Mohawk came from [Martin Scorsese](/martin-scorsese)'s film [Taxi Driver](/taxi-driver). [Plasmatics](/plasmatics) guitarist [Richie Stotts](/richie-stotts) is quoted as saying, "It was the summer of '78. I was watching 'Taxi Driver' one night and the instant I saw [Travis Bickle](/travis-bickle) I thought, 'This is it. This is the look!'"

Two basic types of punk mohawk exist: liberty spike and fan. Liberty-spikes are named such because of their striking resemblance to the spikes on the head of the [Statue of Liberty](/statue-of-liberty), though they first popped up in the [London](/london) scene, later renamed in [NYC](/nyc) by the St. Mark's punks and are often used for their durability in extremy long hair. Fan mohawks try to keep all hair in a uniform spread creating a fan effect.

The name "Mohawk" was perhaps bestowed upon the tribe by the Germans, who, mistaking a personal name for the group name, started to call the Kanien'kehá:ka "Moackh." An English corruption of pronunciation turned it into the familiar "Mohawk" which is still used today. The name of the people in the Mohawk language (which does not possess an /m/ sound) is Kanien'kehá:ka.
