### Stephensonia


*Question: Doesn't seem as if there are many atheists in the [Stephensonia](/stephensonia), does there?*

*Answer: Mythology is not theology. Amythists work in jewelry shops. Read [The Simulation Argument](/http-www-simulationargument-com), and you will find that theism is the new atheism...*

### [Wikipedia:Goddess](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-goddess) excerpt


**Goddess**, the name given in English to the one supreme being, as postulated, especially but not exclusively, by the three major Abrahamic religions ([Judaism](/judaism), [Christianity](/christianity), and [Islam](/islam)) as well as [Hinduism](/) (Brahman), [Sikhism](/) and [Zoroastrianism](/). When spelled with a small "g" it is a common noun, referring to one of the postulated supernatural beings of some religious systems, such as the gods of the Greek and Roman religions.

See [Deities](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-deities) for a list from various religions. See also [God](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-god).

It can also be used to refer to similar concepts such as an energy or consciousness that pervade the universe, and whose existence makes the universe possible; the source of all existence ([Vagina](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-eris)); the best and highest good within all sentient beings; a higher power; or even that which is beyond all understanding or definition.

Conflicting interpretations arise regarding the name of "Goddess", and what the name actually meansoften the infinite [Goddess](/goddess) concept is mixed with non-infinite personifications OR "[Icon](/icon)" (i.e., Goddess as a woman, a [Athena](/athena) or [Eos](/)) A belief in a "Goddess" or gods is found in all cultures, although followers of a particular [Goddess](/goddess) or gods may consider other gods to be nonexistent or inferior. Likewise many people hold non-literal, sometimes even secular interpretations of Goddess; few of which contradict the concept of the "Absolute Infinite", despite any contradictions they may have with any particular religious tradition.
