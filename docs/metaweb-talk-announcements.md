From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

An official announcement that articles are invited on those on the [list of notable Baroque figures](/list-of-notable-baroque-figures) might help kick-start things here. Also on the definition of [Baroque](/baroque) itself. Progress on the annotations would also be of some use to report.

 Good point. There are several areas that I would like to focus people on, because I think that if we develop a few topics well, they will serve as the initial examples for other areas. [User:Tpierce](/user-tpierce) and at least one other user have expressed an interest in this as well. I'm going to update the main page today anyway, so I might get to this one as well. --[Pat](/user-patrick-tufts) 09:37, 17 Oct 2003 (PDT)

Very true, all these projects need to start with some nexus. Really it would be nice to complete the [Young Lady's Illustrated Primer](/young-lady-s-illustrated-primer), let's nudge Neal to release it GNU FDL. ;-)
