This is James Young, a computer geek in San Francisco. I'm posting this to be a teensy bit less anonymous.

I'm here to annotate The Baroque Cycle. I've posted chapter thumbnails for [Quicksilver](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-chapter-thumbnails) and [The Confusion](/stephenson-neal-the-confusion-chapter-thumbnails). 

I got *System of the World* while I was re-reading *Cryptonomicon;* I'm enjoying it too much to switch until I'm finished. I'll post some typos soon.

TODO: Clean spam. Re-organize areas around spammers. Try to enforce some coherence.
