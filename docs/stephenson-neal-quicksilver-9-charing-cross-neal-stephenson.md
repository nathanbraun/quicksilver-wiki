# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:9:Charing Cross (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

The decapitation took place on the side of the
Banqueting House that faces north, in the direction of Charing
Cross. In today's [London](/london), the place called [Charing Cross](/charing-cross-london) is separated
from the Banqueting House by a chunk of Whitehall about a quarter of a
mile long, and so it seems wrong to say that the event took place in
Charing Cross. However, at the time, Charing Cross was a broader
piece of territory. More importantly, it was the only piece of
territory from which an ordinary person might have been able to get a
glimpse of the beheading of the King. So for [Enoch](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-enoch-root) to say this is a
little bit imprecise, but within the normal limits of imprecision that
people employ in conversation.
