From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

This is a page for **Surendranath**.

He appears in the Bonanza volume of The Confusion. When [The Ten](/the-ten) release their galley slaves, he is the Hindoo Banyan who chose to join them. He first appears, I believe, on page 227.

The Banyans are akin to Armenians and Jews in terms of commerce as far as [Jack Shaftoe](/jack-shaftoe) sees it.
