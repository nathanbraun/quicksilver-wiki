(Redirected from [Roger Comstock](/roger-comstock))

Roger Comstock, Marquis of Ravenscar

Roger is of the "Golden" branch of the Comstock family. The Golden Comstocks had some form of a rift with the "Silver" Comstocks that is not explained in the Baroque cycle which led to them being impoverished and spending much time in the Dutch Republic. Roger meets [Daniel Waterhouse](/daniel-waterhouse) while at Trinity College. Roger is a "sizar", or student working his way through college as a servant to the other students.

Roger later becomes quite wealthy and politically astute and becomes Daniel's patron, supporting him and the [Massachusetts Bay Colony Institute of Technologickal Arts](/massachusetts-bay-colony-institute-of-technologickal-arts).

Roger is [loosely based](/stephenson-neal-the-system-of-the-world-71-catherine-barton-neal-stephenson) on [Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-charles-montagu-1st-earl-of-halifax), as is evidenced by his relationship with [Catherine Barton](/catherine-barton).

Roger's relationship to Daniel Waterhouse more closely resembles Avi's relationship to Randy Waterhouse than any Comstock of the twentieth century.
