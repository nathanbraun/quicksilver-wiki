Lordy, lordy. NS joins the real world (ha ha). 

This should be fun if the site's interface gets the refactoring it needs. The goals of the site interface-wise seem more concordant with [http://www.everything2.com/](/http-www-everything2-com) or with the multi-author blog concept than the authorless wiki model.

The front page shouldn't be protected unless it becomes an issue at some point. Trust your contributors.
