Map: Southeast Asia

This is a heavily edited version of [the CIA World Book's Southeast Asia map](/http-www-cia-gov-cia-publications-factbook-reference-maps-southeast-asia-html); this has Kinakuta & Macclesfield Bank sketched in. The Indonesian map under the [Kinakuta](/kinakuta) entry was mostly irrelevant.
