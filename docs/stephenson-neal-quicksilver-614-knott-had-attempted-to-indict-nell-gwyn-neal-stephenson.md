# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:614:Knott had attempted to indict Nell Gwyn (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

It would be a mistake to say that the fictional character of [Knott Bolstrood](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-knott-bolstrood) in this book is based upon [Anthony Ashley Cooper](/anthony-ashley-cooper), 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, because Bolstrood is very different in many ways from Shaftesbury. However, in real life Shaftesbury was a member of [Charles II](/charles-ii)'s [CABAL](/cabal) who eventually got on the King's wrong side and indicted Nell Gwyn and fled to Holland where he died. All of these things are also said of Knott Bolstrood in the book.

I think it also worth noting that Penistone and Shaftesbury are loose equivalents, with "tone" presumably being a shortening of "town" and "bury" of "borough."
