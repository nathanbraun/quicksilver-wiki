# Metaweb:Communal entry

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

A **[Metaweb](/metaweb) communal entry** is the section of an [intermediate page](/metaweb-intermediate-page) where any [contributor](/metaweb-contributor) can add text about the topic, or edit what is already there.

A communal entry should introduce the topic. It can be brief or it can grow to be an encyclopedic entry. In this text, strive for a [neutral point of view](/neutral-point-of-view). 

If you want to create an entry from a particular viewpoint, including a personal view, you should put that in a [authored entry](/metaweb-authored-entry) instead.

A communal entry can be changed at will. Go ahead. If you see as much as a single word you don't like, change it. If you think of something missing, add it. No one "owns" this entry. It is yours to change. [Be bold](/metaweb-be-bold) in editing pages.
