 ***[N.T.S](/user-nealstephenson)**. stated that he can not be sure, but **Goto Dengo's** eating of the Raw Shark on his swim to New Guinea may have been inspired by [Alan Moore](/http-en2-wikipedia-org-wiki-alan-moore)'s **[The Watchmen](/http-en2-wikipedia-org-wiki-watchmen)** comic, which he certainly read.* **Berkeley, California on September 25th, 2003, Book reading and signing at Cody's on Telegraph.**

The **Black Frigate** was a *Meta-metaphor* for the funneling of genres in comics in the USA and UK. [Pirate](/pirates) comics replacing the *underwear on the outside* Superhero in the **Watchman** universe. It also meant other things such as *Hades* and the *Fortress of Solitude*-like arctic hideaway of the antagonist. 

### Mass Drownings


Real life Jack Kennedy was a sailor adrift at sea. In [Cryptonomicon](/cryptonomicon), being lost at sea, often without boat or hope *happens*.

We first meet Dengo as an ex-miner become soldier *cum* poet unafraid of interaction with his *enemy* **[Bobby Shaftoe](/bobby-shaftoe)**. Going so far as to teach *haiku* to the *Alley Oop*-like Marine Raider.![Goto-DengoAF-MW.jpg](/https://web.archive.org/web/20060725171528im_/http://www.metaweb.com/wiki/upload/7/79/Goto-DengoAF-MW.jpg)  
**Takara's Japanese WW2  
Infantryman**

[Cryptonominon Excerpt](/http-www-cryptonomicon-com-text-html):  The Bund is jammed with onlookers in a riot of differently colored clothing, so one patch of uniform drab catches his eye: a group of Nip soldiers who've come down to bid their Yank counterparts a sarcastic farewell. Shaftoe scans the group looking for someone tall and bulky, and picks him out easily. **Goto Dengo**'s waving to him.

Shaftoe takes his helmet off and waves back. Then, on impulse, just for the hell of it, he winds up and flings the helmet directly at Goto Dengo's head. The throw goes awry and Goto Dengo has to knock down about a dozen of his comrades in order to catch it. All of them seem to think that it is a high honor, as well as tremendously amusing, to be knocked down by Goto Dengo.

Twenty seconds later, a comet sails up out of the flesh cosmos of the Bund and bounces on the wooden deck of the gunboat--a hell of a throw. Goto Dengo is showing off his follow-through. The projectile is a rock with a white streamer wrapped around it. Shaftoe runs over and snatches it. The streamer is one of those thousand-stitch headbands (supposedly; he's taken a few off of unconscious Nips, but he's never bothered to count the stitches) that they tie around their heads as a good-luck charm; it has a meatball in the center and some Nip writing to either side. He unties it from around the rock. In so doing he realizes, suddenly, that it's not a rock after all; it is a hand grenade! But good old Goto Dengo was just joking--he didn't pull the pin. A nice souvenir for Bobby Shaftoe.

Shaftoe's first haiku (December 1940) was a quick and dirty adaptation of the Marine Creed:

This is my rifle
 There are many like it but
 This rifle is mine. ...

The *calabash* episode indicates Goto-san's humor. His surviving shows us his adaptability. He seems to have the kind of mind and lifespan of [Daniel Waterhouse](/daniel-waterhouse).
