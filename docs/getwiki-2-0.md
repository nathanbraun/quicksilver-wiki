# GetWiki 2.0

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

**GetWiki 2.0** is the proposed [GetWiki](/getwiki) that may contain features designed to support [GFDL text corpus](/gfdl-text-corpus) management. 

See [GetWiki 2.0 page](/http-www-wikinfo-org-wiki-phtml-title-getwiki-2-0) for details. These features have been proposed on various [Wikinfo](/wikinfo) talk pages:

* [standard wiki URIs](/standard-wiki-uri) to express language and editability in the URI, and ensure that one need only swap domain names to find the parallel article, and also that URIs are easily remembered.
* [interwiki link standard](/interwiki-link-standard) to create one lookup hierarchy per language, e.g. the prefix [phyle](/phyle), not a Wikipedia subspace.
* [interwiki identity standard](/interwiki-identity-standard) possibly based on a [jabber.org](/jabber-org) ID
* explicit [faction](/metaweb-faction) support to deal with collective and alleged identity, and head off [identity theft](/identity-theft) and [identity dispute](/identity-dispute) and remove temptations for [outing](/metaweb-outing) and [framing](/metaweb-framing)
* other movement towards a [wikitext standard](/wikitext-standard)
* other movement towards a [semantic web](/semantic-web), starting with [wiki user pages](/wiki-user-page) and the effectively-semantic [links between article and author](/links-between-article-and-author) that are hard wired in [mediawiki](/mediawiki), to very bad effect.


If these features were supported, it would be a much more suitable software suite for [Metaweb](/metaweb) than [Mediawiki](/mediawiki), as the latter is dealing mostly with implementing a typical [hard security](/hard-security) [permission-based model](/permission-based-model) and dealing with load problems specific to [Wikipedia](/wikipedia). Neither of which are our problem.
