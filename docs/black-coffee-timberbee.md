### Black Coffee



```
   By Tim Berube

```

A single shot rings out  

From where?  

Squeals a feeding pig  

It totters   

On   

Unsteady feet  

Shakes its bloody head in wonder  

And again  

Resumes  

The filling of its belly  


The first shot struck false  

And the next  

And the next  

Until one lands  

Which knocks  

The still feeding beast  

From its feet  

And drives   

The air   

From its lungs  


It is as if thirteen men   

With sharpened knives in trusted hands   

Rush forward  

Rather   

Than the three we are  


Children  

Sent away with their tear stained faces  

Long drags   

Through crusty snow   

Showing   

Their unwillingness to leave  


Wives  
 
Left alone   

Behind barred doors  

Tend   

The fate   

Of other flesh  


Screams echo  

Through the canyons  

Today  

It is innocence   

Which dies  

Along with  

The wide-eyed   

Trusting souls  

Who heeded  

The call   

To feed  


Like some great race  

Faces are set   

Hard  

Determined  

We rush forward  

Hands   

Bodies  

Meet   

Atop a struggling   

Pink form  


A knife flashes  

Descends  

Twin gouts of blood skyward  

Sent  

Raising   

A cry from somewhere   

In pens beyond  


A thunder of hooves  

Tested fences  

Squeals of anger  

Bellows of rage  

Confusion  

Terror   

Yet still   

The knife slides  

Hesitates   

Grates   

Upon bony cartilage  

Halted   

Ever so briefly  

In its steady progress  

A shruddered breath  

Escapes   

From between new found lips  


Struggling legs   

Cease to hold  

And downward   

Our weight would plunge  

Should we relax  

Our grip  


Heaven set eyes   

Glaze  

Yet still we hold  

As  

The blade   

Has not yet
Done its work  


Onward  

It plunges  

Deeper   

It delves  

To strike   

The still   

Beating center   

Within  


Screams of betrayal  

From beyond  

Merge   

With the sounds of anguish  

From nearby  


As one we turn and flee the scene  

Dying muscles  

Sinews  

Find   

New vigor  

Striking out in greater and greater spasms  

Flinging the heaving body  

Skyward  

To fall again  

And again  

To  

The blood soaked Earth  


Unfeeling hooves scatter men like straw  

Threatening   

Gate  

And  

Bone  

And   

Flesh alike  


We gather  

Again   

About the great  

Roaring   

Propane jets  

Which   

Boil water   

For the scalding   

And the scraping  

Yet to follow  


We watch   

As once terrified   

Brothers   

Return  

Descending  

In a body  

To feed  

Upon the blood  

Of their   

Now  

Lifeless companion   

Darting  

Occasionally   

From   

Ever stilling feet  

Ever slowing form  


And black coffee  

Is handed all around  


With upturned face  

And  

Shining eyes  

I take it up   

In joyous hands  

To sip upon this  


```
 

```
Sweetest   

Of  

Nectars  


Sweet only  

On this day  


The day  

When all  

The pigs  

Will die
