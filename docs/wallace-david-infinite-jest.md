# Wallace:David:Infinite Jest

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

This is the start of a MetaWeb annotation for David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest, a brilliant 1996 novel that has captured the minds and souls of hundreds, if not thousands, of people.

Active discussion of the book happens often on [wallace-l](/wallace-l), a mailing list that averages 100 messages per week. Because [wallace-l](/wallace-l) includes discussion of Wallace's many other writings, though, as well as Wallace's career and a number of tangential topics, you may not wish to subscribe until you've had a look at the [archives](/http-www-waste-org-mail-list-wallace-l).

## Links to outside resources



There are many scattered resources on the Internet that deal with the book, but the most comprehensive one is [The Howling Fantods](/http-www-thehowlingfantods-com-inf-htm). There is also a [character guide](/http-www-ilstu-edu-tffeene-ij-characterguide-html), a [scene-by-scene guide](/http-www-english-uga-edu-koneill-infinite-htm) to the book, an [index](/http-members-aol-com-russillosm-ijndx-html), and an [essay](/http-www-thehowlingfantods-com-ij-first-htm) about the drafts of the book.

Plus, there are many [Wallace:David:Infinite\_Jest:Reviews](/wallace-david-infinite-jest-reviews) of the book.

## Detailed discussion of the book



There are several ways to approach this metaweb. At the most detailed level, there is a page-by-page commentary on the book, that's either original to MetaWeb or comes from the various group re-reads of the book by posters on [wallace-l](/wallace-l). Here is the master list: [Wallace:David:Infinite\_Jest:page-by-page commentary](/wallace-david-infinite-jest-page-by-page-commentary)

At the second level of abstration, there are pages that deal with themes or characters or other larger issues about the book. You can hunt down information by character: [Wallace:David:Infinite\_Jest:character commentary](/wallace-david-infinite-jest-character-commentary) and by theme or topic, although that'll take a while for the MetaWeb to fill in:
[Wallace:David:Infinite\_Jest:Themes](/wallace-david-infinite-jest-themes)

Finally, at a third level of abstration, there is discussion about the book's authorship, [Wallace:David:Infinite\_Jest:Authorship](/wallace-david-infinite-jest-authorship), choices of narrative voice, [Wallace:David:Infinite\_Jest:Narrator](/wallace-david-infinite-jest-narrator), use of literary themes, [Wallace:David:Infinite\_Jest:Literature](/wallace-david-infinite-jest-literature), and of course its footnotes: [Wallace:David:Infinite\_Jest:Footnotes](/wallace-david-infinite-jest-footnotes).

## Pending Questions



Finally, the book is complicated and intentionally ambiguous, so that readers are often mystified by the thing. There is a master list of [Wallace:David:Infinite\_Jest:Pending Questions](/wallace-david-infinite-jest-pending-questions).
