* 1. In response to Leeuwenhoek, Robert Hooke (1635-1703) began to keep a detailed record of his own microscopic observations. Published in 1667 as Micrographia, Hooke's work also included his sketches made of objects under the glass, including the following one of a flea. Hooke's work in turn inspired other scientists and amateur scientists, including Samuel Pepys.
