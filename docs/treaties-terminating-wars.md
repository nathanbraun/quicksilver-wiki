*Another **Logic Mill** card assumed to be forefront in [Daniel](/daniel-waterhouse)'s mind as 1713 is coming to an end.*

With Catholicism waning, *Rome* is unlikely to get support for wars against Lutherians and other heretics ...

#### Treaty of Utrecht (1713)


Christendom has seen little peace --
* ***(Hapsburg)*** [Charles V](/charles-v) was made to sign the Peace of Augsburg (1555), however, which allowed each prince to determine whether his people should be Roman Catholic or Lutheran. The Peace of Augsburg had weakened the authority of the Holy Roman emperors. At the end of the Thirty Years' War the empire received its final blow from the Treaty of Westphalia (1648), which further strengthened the local princes by allowing them to make treaties with foreign powers. The way was thus opened for the rise of Prussia, which was eventually to humble the Hapsburgs and assume the leadership in a new German empire.
* ***(War of the Spanish Succession)*** The Spanish line of the Hapsburgs ended in 1700 when Charles II of Spain died childless and brotherless. One of his sisters had married Louis XIV of France; another married Emperor Leopold I. These rulers had each planned how the rich Spanish possessions should be divided. Charles left a will, however, that made Louis's younger grandson, Philip, heir to all his possessions. England became alarmed at this growth in French power and joined with France's enemies, Austria and Holland, in a Grand Alliance (1701). This led to the War of the Spanish Succession, which spread through Europe and even to America, where it was called [Queen Anne](/queen-anne)'s War. In Europe the Austrian commander, Prince Eugene of Savoy, and the English general, the duke of Marlborough, won the major battles against France but won no decisive victory over the country. Finally Louis XIV agreed to a compromise.  the  [Treaty of Utrecht (1713)](/treaties-of-utrecht).
* ***(The Treaty of Utrecht)*** gave each of the foes a share in the Spanish booty. Philip V retained Spain. Some of the colonies went to England, along with Gibraltar. The Spanish Netherlands became the Austrian Netherlands, and Austria also received Naples and Milan, obtaining a hold on Italy that it would greatly enlarge later. In summation: The War of the Spanish Succession began in 1701 with a dynastic quibble: Would the throne of Spain, which then ruled an empire that stretched from Milan to Mexico, pass to a grandson of the King of France? England, Holland and Austria said no, and assembled a grand anti-French alliance. There was many a famous victory; the Duke of Marlborough, the English commander, got a splendid palace out of the Battle of Blenheim. Then, after a decade, England tired of taxation, impeached the duke and quit. The war stuttered to a halt as other allies threw in their successive towels. **England confirmed its reputation as perfidious Albion.** (Wikipedia says:) The Treaties of Utrecht - (April 11, 1713) were signed in [Utrecht](/utrecht), a city of the United Provinces. Along with the Treaties of Rastatt and Baden, this concluded the War of the Spanish Succession (as well as Queen Anne's War). They confirmed Philip V as the king of Spain, provided that Spain and France remain separate. The Spanish Netherlands, Milan, and Naples were granted to Austria. England was granted possession of the Hudson Bay Territory, Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia. France and the Holy Roman Empire would not settle their differences until 1714, and Spain and Portugal did not cease hostilities until 1715. The main provisions of the treaties confirmed that Louis XIV's grandson Philip V would remain on the throne of Spain, and retain Spain's new world colonies. Many of Spain's other territories were partitioned out among the allied powers. The Emperor received the Spanish Netherlands, the Duchy of Milan, Naples, and Sardinia. The Duke of Savoy received Sicily and some strips of land in Lombardy. The British received Gibraltar and Minorca, which they had captured during the war. There were also some colonial provisions pertaining to North America: France recognized British control of the Hudson Bay Territory and Newfoundland and ceded Acadia to the British. France retained Cape Breton Island, the St. Lawrence Islands, and fishing rights off of Newfoundland.

#### Phasing out Privateers as Augmentation of a Nation's Navy


Think of Drake and Morgan and how they advanced the English position. Both had 'letters of marque' which allowed tremendous profits from their nation's enemies.

* ***(Piracy)*** A factor that pushed many patriot privateers into outlaw piracy was the peace treaties between England, France and Spain that came in 1697. Although low-grade hostilities never stopped, it would be another 40 years before war was declared again against Spain. Without official war, there was a surplus in mariner labor, since the Royal Navy was no longer needed to fill its ranks. Wages for sailors dropped in times of peace and many mariners had become accustomed to the financial gains that could come from plunder. These factors lead many to a career in piracy. *Which gives us the infamous Blackbeard made impotent by the [Minerva](/minerva)'s [van Hoek](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-captain-van-hoek).*

#### Arty Messenger of Peace


* ***(Aside - [Peter Paul Rubens](/http-en2-wikipedia-org-wiki-rubens)*** - His picture in the National Gallery, London, [The Allegory of Peace and War](/http-gallery-euroweb-hu-html-r-rubens-3allegor), 1629, reflects, and even illustrates, his strong concern for peace. It was given to King [Charles I](/charles-i) and helped to create a peace treaty between London and Madrid. He even visited Holland which was enemy territory partly to meet Dutch artists and partly to seek for reconciliation. It was here that he came up against the attitude that courtiers should not use their hands an any art or craft. But because he was such a fine artist King Philip and King Charles both enjoyed his company as well as his art. Rubens is to be seen as a highly talented artist, a scholar and diplomat, brilliant at drawing and painting).

**Allegory on the Blessings of Peace** is the only surviving Rubens' ceiling painting.
