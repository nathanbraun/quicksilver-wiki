# Talk:A very brief introduction to the Royal Society (Talith)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

We would not have had the [Royal Society of London for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge](/royal-society-of-london-for-the-improvement-of-natural-knowledge) without the Invisble College -- see the 2nd paragraph of [Boyle's](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-robert-boyle) entry. 

Thought this was worth sharing -- [Wilkins](/john-wilkins) presented Thomas Spratt's *The History of the Royal Society of London for the Improving of Natural Knowledge* to their royal sponsor. 

On its frontipiece, one can see several [Masonic](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-freemasonry) symbols shown on this image -- note that [Charles II's](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-charles-ii-of-england) bust is resting on a [Enochian](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-enoch-root) column. The link to the bibical [Enoch](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-enoch-root) is that Masons hold the [Bibical Enoch](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-enoch) to be a temple builder.

 â€¢ The frontispiece was most likely done by Wenceslaus Hollar though it is identified as being John Evelyn's work.
