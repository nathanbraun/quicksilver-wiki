# Metaweb:Mo' Metaweb (Patrick Tufts)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Wanted to give you an update on the site. AMI produced a database backup of the site which several active users are now looking at installing on another machine. There are no guarantees, but there are several efforts to bring this site back up elsewhere. It won't be called the Metaweb, but it will hopefully be running on a more modern version of MediaWiki.
