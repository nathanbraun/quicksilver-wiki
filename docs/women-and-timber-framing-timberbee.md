# Women And Timber Framing (Timberbee)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

When I first entered the world of Timber Framing, there were relatively few women joiners, and no female Hewers. Though there are more women entering the craft, today, this statement still holds true.

One of the comments I have often heard, is that the work is far to brutal, the physical demands are far to great. I could not disagree more.

As a Traditional Timber Framer who has moved almost every piece he has cut by hand, regardless of size or weight, strength plays a far lesser role than determination, desire, and inventiveness. 

I began working at a weight of 115 pounds, Today, almost 16 years later, I fluctuate from 195 to 205 pounds. Five years ago I could pick 350 from the floor, with little problem, that is not so far from where I stand today. While that lift is a fair bit more than the average, it is only the absolute lowest threshold for some levels of Power Lifting.

More relevant, it does not even approach the average weights of the majority of the timbers on **Any** of my projects.

One thing, which I am constantly telling my people, is that strength is good, but endurance, and the ability to use your heads will more than make up for this. 

The most important aspect of moving a timber is not, "Can I lift this", or, "How do I lift this" but;
* Where are you going to move this?

And,
* **Why**?


If something needs to be moved, then you do it. With no complaints, if you can't physicaly man handle it, then that's what Bars, PeeVees, and rollers are for. 

The Brain is the most important muscle you have on a job site, and, unfortunately, it is often the least used. 

I will not beat around the bush here, when I am running a crew, I am not considered to be Easy in terms of the physical demands I place upon people, it is hard work, and I typicaly seem to make it harder than it needs to be. If I can physicaly pick a piece, I will do so without waiting for help, and I tend to expect this from those who work for me.

But, I also expect people to know their own limitations, and not to exceed these, despite whatever pressure may be brought to bear. While it often seems, on any given job, that overall strength is the most important aspect, the truth of the situation is that efficency, motion, and **Attitude** Top the list.

Not having to tell someone what to do, when to do it, or how to get it done, are some of the most prized traits any worker can have. If What you do more than meets the standards of the job, if your work does not have to be re-visited by another, if you don't stand for crap, especialy from your co-workers, when you are not in the wrong -- That is, if you stand up for yourself in a no-nonsense manner, get the job done, don't mope around, help when help is needed, and allow others to hang themselves with their own rope, then, you will be one of the most prized people on the job site, regardless of Gender or Physical attributes; Haul your own weight, and don't be a complete wall-flower.

If you make yourself a target; if you are over defensive, over self-concious about some aspect of yourself, to thin skinned, or too dense to see what is happening, these will become tremendous vunerabilities. 

It is ok to have a sense of humor, it is ok to use that humor **Ruthlessly**, at times, to "Dress Down" others, and to hide your own "**Perceived**" shortcomings.

Keeping your eye on what is *Truely* important is Vital. 
Showing;
* Initiative
* Drive
* Desire
* Brains
* **Maturity**

and
* A **Healthy** sense of humor


all outweigh concerns of Physicality.

That said, People are generally "Weak" because they **Don't Do**, not because they are geneticaly incapable of being stronger. As you **Do**, you will get stronger. Period. Getting stronger will help, but, Only, if you have all of the above. 

If the choice is between the strongest man in the World, but someone who is as Dumb as a stone -- doesn't know one end of a chisel from the other -- and a Woman who can barely lift brace stock, but knows her stuff, produces good work, and fast!, and **Does Not Need To Be Told What To Do**, it's only a tough call if Relatives or predjuidice are involved, but, if a firm deadline is a key issue, and money is on the line, both nepatism, and sexism tend to go out the door, and quickly. 

There is still sexism in the market, and it is, possibly a, very, bumpy ride for many, but arm yourself with the knowledge that there is nothing which inherently bars, or allows, one gender over another, in this field. 

The bottom line is;
* **If something is an obstacle -- because of Weight, attitude, or position --find out what it is that, Actually, needs to be done, and then, figure out how to get it done, with what you have, not lament that which you Don't have.**
