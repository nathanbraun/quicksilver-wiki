**Cosmology** is the study of the universe as a whole - encompassing the full span of time, scale and distance. Its main topics mix [astronomy](/astronomy), [mathematics](/mathematics) and theoretical [physics](/physics), to discover things about our universe which these areas cannot find in isolation.

Definition of "cosmos" from Wikipedia :
The cosmos is the universe, especially when thought of as an orderly or harmonious [system](/system). Sometimes the term 'cosmos' is considered to be only the observed universe, while the term "universe" refers to all that exists whether it has been discovered or not (see [ontology](/ontology)). 'Cosmos' is the "known universe." The word is derived from Greek. (compare; Multiverse)

By these definitions, it should be clear that some of the work of [Leibniz](/leibniz), [Spinoza](/spinoza) and many other thinkers of the time could be counted as cosmology in a wide sense.
