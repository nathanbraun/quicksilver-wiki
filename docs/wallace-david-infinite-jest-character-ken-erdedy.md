# Wallace:David:Infinite Jest:Character:Ken Erdedy

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

wallace-l 25 November 1996: Ken Erdedy is at Ennet House. He is the one involved in the comical AA hugging episode on pages 503-507 where some guy threatens to rip Erdedy's head off and shit down his neck if he won't give him a hug. There's another mention of "Ken E." on page 536. At first I didn't realize that this was the same guy who'd been in the book earlier---too many pages had passed in between, so I had to go back and check. I believe (from hearing it on "St. Paul Sunday Mornings" recently) that the name "Erdedy" was the name of a famous European muscian, for whatever that is worth.
