From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Maybe just coincidence, but 'Faithless Sally Brown' is a poem of similar metre and vaguely sailorish theme (although more of a romance than a bawdy tale heavy in double-entendre) by Thomas Hood (1799-1845), a writer of both serious and humorous articles and poems for the likes of Punch magazine.
