From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

[El Escorial](/el-escorial) was the last residence of [Philip II of Spain](/philip-ii-of-spain), but it was not the courtplace for his successors, just one of the Royal Palaces, suitable for summer since it's higher than Madrid.
[La Granja](/la-granja) was more in the [Versailles](/versailles) style.

The novel action takes place in [June 18](/june-18) (Gregorian) / [7 June](/june-7) (Julian) 1714.
In [February 14](/february-14) (Gregorian), [María Luisa Gabriela of Savoy](/maría-luisa-gabriela-of-savoy) died in Madrid.
She was the first wife of [Philip V of Spain](/philip-v-of-spain) and the first [Bourbon](/bourbon) to be interred in El Escorial.
