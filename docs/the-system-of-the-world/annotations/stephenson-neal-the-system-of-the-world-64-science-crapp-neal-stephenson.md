# Stephenson:Neal:The System of the World:64:Science Crapp (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

The word Crapp is being used anachronistically here; it was not part of the English language in 1714. I used it after much soul-searching because I was unable to find a contemporary equivalent.
