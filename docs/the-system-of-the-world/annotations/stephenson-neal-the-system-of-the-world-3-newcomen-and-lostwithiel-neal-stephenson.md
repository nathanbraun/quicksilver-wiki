# Stephenson:Neal:The System of the World:3:Newcomen and Lostwithiel (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Lostwithiel is fictional. [Newcomen](/thomas-newcomen) is a real historical figure. Alas, not that much is known about him. I have tried to do justice to him based on what little is known and on what I know of engineers in general.

Google "Trevithick" to find all sorts of information about the development of early steam engines in Cornwall.
