From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Stephenson makes [a] historical error. On p. 122 of "System of the World" he notes that pendulums are sought by Natural Philsophers and mesmerists. it is true that the pendula are sometimes used in hypnotic inductions, but Franz Anton Mesmer (1734-1815), who pioneered this type of healing practice was not yet even a mote in the eye of his parents when the action takes place.
