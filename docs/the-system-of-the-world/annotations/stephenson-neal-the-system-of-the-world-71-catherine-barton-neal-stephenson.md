# Stephenson:Neal:The System of the World:71:Catherine Barton (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Catherine Barton was a real person and this is an actual poem that was composed in her honor and recited at the Kit-Cat Clubb. In real life she was the mistress of the Earl of Halifax, who at other times in his life was also known as Charles Montague and Baron Halifax of Halifax. He is one of a few people upon whom the fictional character of Roger Comstock is loosely based.
