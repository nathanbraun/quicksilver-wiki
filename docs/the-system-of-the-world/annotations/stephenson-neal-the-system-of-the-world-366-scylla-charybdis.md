## Stephensonia


Scylla and Charibdis are the names of the guardian dogs that [Eliza](/eliza) carries around in [Hanover](/hanover).

In page 673, [Caroline of Ansbach](/caroline-of-ansbach) addresses [Newton](/newton) and [Leibniz](/leibniz) using the metaphorical sense:
[...]And yet there is between you a schism as deep as that between Scylla and Charybdis.

### Scylla


**Scylla** is one of the two [sea monsters](/sea-monster) in [Greek mythology](/greek-mythology) (the other being [Charybdis](/)) which lives on one side of a narrow channel of water. Traditionally this has been associated with the [Strait of Messina](/strait-of-messina) between [Italy](/italy) and [Sicily](/sicily) but more recently this theory has been challenged and the alternative location of Cape Skilla in north west [Greece](/greece) suggested. Scylla has the face and torso of a woman, but from her flanks grow six dog heads and her body below that sprouts twelve canine legs and a fish's tail. She was one of the children of [Phorcys](/phorcys) and [Ceto](/ceto) known as the [Phorcydes](/phorcydes).

In [Homer](/homer)'s *[Odyssey](/odyssey)*, [Odysseus](/odysseus) successfully navigates his ship past Scylla and Charybdis.

As retold by [Thomas Bulfinch](/thomas-bulfinch), Scylla was originally a beautiful [nymph](/nymph). She scorned her many suitors and chose to live among the [Nereids](/nereids) instead, until one day [Glaucus](/glaucus) saw and fell in love with her. Glaucus was a mortal fisherman who had previously been transformed by chewing a plant, gaining the form of a fish from his waist down. When Glaucus declared her love to Scylla she fled, taking him for a monster. Glaucus sought the help of [Circe](/circe), hoping that this witch could make Scylla to love him with her herbs, but Circe fell in love with Glaucus herself and asked him to forget Scylla. Glaucus rejected her request, declaring that his love for Scylla was eternal.

Circe was enraged by Glaucus' refusal, and turned her anger on the girl whom he loved. She went and poisoned the water which Scylla used to bathe with her magical herbs. When Scylla waded into the water, the submerged half of her body was transformed into a combination of fish joined with six ferocious dogs' heads sprouting from around her waist. The dogs attacked and devoured anyone who came near, beyond her ability to control, and Scylla fled to the shore of the strait to live there alone.

It is said that by the time [Aeneas](/aeneas)' fleet came through the strait after the fall of [Troy](/troy), Scylla had been changed into a [dangerous rock](/hazard-to-navigation) outcropping which still stands there to this day.

### Charybdis


In [Greek mythology](/greek-mythology), **Charybdis**, or **Kharybdis** ("sucker down"), is a sea monster, daughter of [Poseidon](/poseidon) and [Gaia](/gaia-mythology), who swallows huge amounts of water three times a day and then spouts it back out again, forming an enormous whirlpool. She lay on one side of a narrow channel of water. 

On the other side of the strait was [Scylla](/), another sea-monster. The two sides of the strait are within an arrow's range of each other, so close that sailors attempting to avoid Charybdis will pass too close to Scylla and vice versa.

The phrase *between Scylla and Charibdis* means to be between in a narrow strip between two dangers.

The [Argonauts](/argonauts) were able to avoid both dangers because they were guided by [Thetis](/thetis), one of the [Nereids](/nereids). Odysseus was not so fortunate; he chose to risk Scylla at the cost of some of his crew rather than lose the whole ship to Charybdis. (Homer's *Odyssey*, Book XII).

Traditionally location of Charybdis has been associated with the Strait of Messina off the coast of Sicily, opposite the rock called Scylla. The whirlpool there is caused by the meeting of currents, but is seldom dangerous. Recently scholars have looked again at the location and suggested this association was a misidentification and that a more likely origin for the story could be found near Cape Skilla in north west Greece.

Charybdis was originally a sea-[nymph](/nymph) who flooded her father's kingdom, the sea, until [Zeus](/zeus) turned her into a [monster](/monster).
