From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Daniel shares many traits with his descendant, [Randy Waterhouse](/randy-waterhouse). Surprisingly, among these is an affinity for classifying people based on Tolkienish mythology (nearly two centuries before the birth of Tolkien). Below are some pre-Tolkien examples of "some Saxon ring saga" that may have inspired such thoughts for Daniel.

### Saxon Ring Sagas (Pre-Tolkien)


* Wagner's *Ring of the Nibelung* was based on some prior mythological sources rather than created from whole cloth. The primary source was the *Nibelungenlied* (see below).
* The proto-Arthurian saga *Brut*.
* *Beowulf* (see below).


### Origin of the Mythical Dwarf


from [Wikipedia](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-dwarf)

Stories of dwarves may have a historical background: during the Bronze Age, tin miners from southern and southeastern Europe slowly migrated northwest, since the relatively rare tin, which is needed to make bronze, was more common in the north. Being southerners, they were generally of much shorter stature than northern Europeans and had darker skin, hair and beards. Their knowledge of metallurgy must have seemed quite magical to the northerners, whose lifestyle still followed neolithical forms; their superiour weapons and armor might well have been perceived as enchanted. This would explain why stories of dwarves are mostly restricted to Northern Europe, and also why dwarves are portrayed as workers, while few other mythological creatures seem to be associated with any kind of organized industry.

### Note


In the ***Legends of the Dark Knight*** #35/36 Batman comic - Bruce Wayne (Batman) and a descendent of "Jon the Viking Prince" (who was quite the hero in the 1940s and 1950s) are used to investigate evil dwarves up to no good.

The interior art is quite fun. [Mile High Comics](/http-www-milehighcomics-com) would be your best bet to get them if your local shop lacks them.
