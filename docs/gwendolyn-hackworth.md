Not much needs to be said about this woman, as she is a prime example of the sort of shallow minded, presumptious, snobby people that [Lord Finkle-McGraw](/lord-finkle-mcgraw) is attempting to save Victorian Society from with his primer project. It apparently takes [Hackworth](/john-percival-hackworth) to save [Fiona](/fiona-hackworth) from [Victorian Society](/victorian-society).
