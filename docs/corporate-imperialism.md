[Neal Stephenson](/neal-stephenson) gave a famous public talk at *Computers, Freedom and Privacy 2000* in [Toronto, Canada](/toronto-canada), on his theory of [domineering systems](/domineering-systems), which he proposed as an alternative to concern about only one *[Big Brother](/big-brother)* at a time. There being many corporations competing for what they call [mindshare](/mindshare) and [goodwill](/goodwill), not to mention credit, there is probably no small merit to applying Neal's analysis to corporate domination. The [phyle](/phyle) (from [The Diamond Age](/the-diamond-age)) is also a sort of evolved combination of corporation, [union](/union) and [tribe](/tribe) with some [guild](/guild) features; In that universe the phyles and [FOQNEs](/foqne) dominate the economy and deal with each other only through global standard [Common Economic Protocol](/common-economic-protocol). A bit like the [WTO](/wto). [George Lucas](/george-lucas) at about the same time seems to have included a similar critique in his [Star Wars Episode I](/star-wars-episode-i).

**Corporate imperalism** arguably emerged in the [Baroque](/baroque) era with the [Dutch East India Company](/dutch-east-india-company), the [French East India Company](/french-east-india-company), the [London Virginia Company](/london-virginia-company), the Swedish East India Company, the Muscovy Company, the Dutch and British West India Companies, the [British East Indies Company](/british-east-indies-company) and [Hudson's Bay Company](/hudson-s-bay-company) which were given [letters patent](/letters-patent) to expand [colonialism](/colonialism) directly for profit to (what is now) [India](/india), the Carribean, North America, and [Canada](/canada). These appear to have been critical to the development of the [neoclassical philosophy](/neoclassical-philosophy) and [neoclassical economics](/neoclassical-economics), whereas [social welfarism](/social-welfarism) and [social democracy](/social-democracy) have tended to dominate domestic politics of colonizing powers in the [20th century](/20th-century).

This history is also key to understanding [corporate personhood](/corporate-personhood), [management usurpation](/management-usurpation) and the various controversies about that and the [shareholder activism](/shareholder-activism) and [ethical investing](/ethical-investing) and [moral purchasing](/moral-purchasing) movements. All of which have their origins in parallel in [Baroque](/baroque) times.

In this millenium, the ideological conflict over corporate status is stark and often polarized: scoffing phrases such as [dollar diplomacy](/http-recyclopedia-info-wiki-wiki-phtml-title-dollar-diplomacy), [New totalitarianism](/http-recyclopedia-info-wiki-wiki-phtml-title-new-totalitarianism), [market theology](/http-recyclopedia-info-wiki-wiki-phtml-title-market-theology), more neutral ones like "[corporate globalization](/http-recyclopedia-info-wiki-wiki-phtml-title-corporate-globalization)" and alliances of opposing forces like the [green movement](/http-recyclopedia-info-wiki-wiki-phtml-title-green-movement), "[anti-globalization movement](/http-recyclopedia-info-wiki-wiki-phtml-title-anti-globalization-movement)" (now called "[altermondialiste](/http-recyclopedia-info-wiki-wiki-phtml-title-altermondialiste)") describe this corporate hegemony and allege and predict various effects for it and of it. Most notably, the collapse of any semblance of [democracy](/http-recyclopedia-info-wiki-wiki-phtml-title-democracy) in both colonized and colonizing countries.

Competing theories like [oil imperialism](/http-recyclopedia-info-wiki-wiki-phtml-title-oil-imperialism) emphasize the role of [energy economics](/http-recyclopedia-info-wiki-wiki-phtml-title-energy-economics) over the form of organization of the actual productive enterprise.
