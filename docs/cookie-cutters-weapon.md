**Cookie Cutters** are a form of nanotech weaponry. They are deployed by the thousands in the target's bloodstream either through injection or as the payload of a series of [ballisticules](/ballisticule). They are detonated by remote control, but in order to reach maximum potency the cookie cutters must be evenly distributed in the target's bloodstream. The amount of time this takes (seven minutes) has givin this weapon a rather colourful colloquial name: "Seven Minute Special". It is possible to detonate all of the cookie cutters in a target, or only one. The latter method is painful and debilitating but not fatal, and is often used when capture is of more benefit than killing, for example in police raids.

The weapon h√¶mocules consist of a pair of couterrotating segemented rings, moving at a very high rate. Upon detonation, the bonds between segments dissolve, allowing centrifugal force to carry them at hypersonic velocities. As the flying segments near the speed of sound, shock waves build up and cause all the damage, turning organs into mush and producing a series of bright red crescents on the skin. When allowed to disperse properly, the weapon is instantly and certainly fatal.
