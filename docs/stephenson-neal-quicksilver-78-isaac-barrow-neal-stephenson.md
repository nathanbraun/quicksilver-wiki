# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:78:Isaac Barrow (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

As Huygens, Barrow, [Newton](/isaac-newton), and [Hooke](/robert-hooke) have all now
been mentioned, this is as good a place as any to exhort people to buy
the book "Huygens and Barrow, Newton & Hooke: Pioneers in mathematical
analysis and catastrophe theory from evolvents to quasicrystals" [ISBN 3-7643-2383-3](/), [ISBN 0-8176-2383-3](/) by
V.I. Arnol'd. Unfortunately for me I did not discover this remarkable
little volume until after 99% of the Baroque Cycle had been
written. Thanks to Henry Cohn for bringing it to my attention.
