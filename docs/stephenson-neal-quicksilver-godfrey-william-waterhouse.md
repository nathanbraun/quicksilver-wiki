# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:Godfrey William Waterhouse

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Godfrey William Waterhouse is named for his father [Daniel](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-daniel-waterhouse)'s friend [Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz](/gottfried-wilhelm-von-leibniz). The child seems to view the way his mechanically geared father makes use of [Wilkins](/john-wilkins)' [Cryptonomicon](/cryptonomicon) as a doorstop as appropriate. Friend to [Ben Franklin](/ben-franklin) in Newtowne Mass.

His tussle with young [Ben](/benjamin-franklin) over apples triggers a memory of [Enoch Root](/enoch-root)'s about [Isaac Newton](/isaac-newton) at *grade school* earlier in 1654.
