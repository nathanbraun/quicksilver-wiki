# Anachronisms

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

There are many anachronisms through out the Baroque Cycle. Many of these are non-accidental anachronisms, as one would expect to see in a novel set during and earlier era. Rather many anachronisms seem to be but in by design by Mr. Stephenson:

## Anachronisms in Quicksilver


* "[to come](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-253-what-is-to-come-eric-s-raymond)" Quicksilver, 253


## Anachronisms in The Confusion



## Anachronisms in The System of the World


* "...the Three Desiderata: location, location, and location..." The System of the World, 107. Is this an anachronism?
* "We came up to take in the view, the seemed to say, and never expected the Spanish Inquisition" The System of the World, 248. Not really an anachronism, more of a tounge-in-cheek joke by Mr. Stephenson, an obvious reference the the Monty Python sketch.
* "[hot-swapped](/stephenson-neal-the-system-of-the-world-392-hot-swapped-joelfinkle)", The System of the World, 392.
