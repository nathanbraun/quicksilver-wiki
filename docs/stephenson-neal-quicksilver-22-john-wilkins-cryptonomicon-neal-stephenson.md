# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:22:John Wilkins...Cryptonomicon (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Follow the [John Wilkins](/john-wilkins) link to find some non-Metaweb biographies and other information about the real Wilkins. His relevance to the Baroque Cycle is as follows: in
1641 he published a book called Mercury, which has been described by
David Kahn, in "The Codebreakers," as the first English-language work on
[cryptology](/cryptology). The [Baroque Cycle](/stephenson-neal-baroque-cycle) and my novel [Cryptonomicon](/stephenson-neal-cryptonomicon) are both set
in a slightly different alternate universe in which Wilkins's treatise
was called Cryptonomicon. And just to make things a little more confusing,
in the real world is an Internet document called [Cyphernomicon](/cyphernomicon), by Tim
May, which predates my work by many years!
