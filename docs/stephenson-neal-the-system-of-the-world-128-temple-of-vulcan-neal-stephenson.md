# Stephenson:Neal:The System of the World:128:Temple of Vulcan (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Roger Comstock's Temple of Vulcan is loosely inspired by Montague House, which Hooke designed for Ralph Montague in the 1670s. Later, Montague House became the British Museum, though not before it had been gutted by fire and rebuilt.

There were a lot of Montagues. The character of Roger Comstock has aspects in common with both Ralph and Charles (later the Baron, then the Earl, of Halifax).
