From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

 meme 
a self-sustaining [me](/me), independent of outside [dataspace](/dataspace)'s [datascape](/datascape) AND resources for it's existance AND potential of execution AND OR potential for [narrative](/narrative) manipulation. In the notation used by [A.A](/user-agquarx) 11:28, 2005 Feb 1 (PST) [me](/me), you could write it as { me :: me } (read "me points onto MU onto points me" OR "me is me is me is...(recursion)". To replicate, a [meme](/meme) needs some outside resource, for example, a [reader](/reader) OR a dozen millions of [readers](/reader).
