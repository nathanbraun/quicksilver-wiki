### Eutropians


Several of [Randy Waterhouse](/randy-waterhouse)'s and Avi's friends and associates are Eutropians, who wear bracelets bearing information on the necessary protocols to prep their bodies for [cryonic suspension](/cryonic-suspension) in the event of their death. In this, these characters are fictional analogs to the real world's [Extropians](/extropians) and other [transhumanists](/transhumanists), who tend to maintain [cryonics contracts](/cryonics-contracts), wear such bracelets, are involved in [crypto-hacker](/crypto-hacker) and [libertarian](/libertarian) causes and projects, and are generally nerds of the dwarf or elvish variety who enjoy cool technology, be it [cryptosystems](/cryptosystems), [high-energy weaponry](/reason), [van Eck phreaking](/van-eck-phreaking), [guns](/ultima-ratio-regum), [private space development](/private-space-development), among other things. 

They dislike [luddites](/) like [Andrew Loeb](/andrew-loeb) and statists like the *Golden* [Comstock](/comstock) clan. Extropians have been involved in the founding of [HavenCo](/http-www-havenco-com), the first real [Data haven](/data-havens), based at [SeaLand](/), the real-life tiny independent principality off the east coast of England, as well as other island and nation building projects, space development, software development, as well as the American Libertarian movement.

Extropians view the transhumanist movement as a follow-on to the [humanist](/humanist) movement spawned by the [Enlightenment](/enlightenment) that [Newton](/newton), [Leibniz](/leibniz), [Locke](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-170-john-locke-was-writing-a-constitution-for-carolina-mike-lorrey-alan-sinder) and the other [Natural Philosophers](/royal-society-of-london-for-the-improvement-of-natural-knowledge) founded, to the point that many celebrate December 25th as Newtonmas, as it is Newton's Birthday. 

They believe that the humanists abandoned the Enlightenment approval of scientific and technological progress to advance the species and solve mankinds problems during the late industrial age as pollution and labor issues triggered distopic backlash. Transhumanism is intent on claiming the mantle that the humanists abandoned as humanism became more concerned with using government to 'solve' problems, such as the improper molestation of trees, spotted owls, properly redistributing property to those that did not earn it, and righting all of the ethnic wrongs committed by rich dead white men in the misty past.

**Extropianism**, also referred to as **extropy**, is an evolving framework of values and standards for continuously improving the human condition. Extropianism describes a pragmatic consilience of [transhuman](/) thought guided by a conscious, pro-active, self-directed approach to human evolution and progress. 

Originated by a set of principles developed by Dr. [Max More](/): *[The Principles of Extropy](/http-www-extropy-org-principles-htm)*, extropianism stems from the transhuman tradition of [F.M. Esfandiary](/) and as conceptualized by More, places strong emphasis on rational thinking and practical [optimism](/). According to More, these principles "do not specify particular beliefs, technologies, or policies". Extropians share an optimistic view of the [future](/), expecting considerable advances in computational power, [life extension](/), [nanotechnology](/) and the like. Many extropians foresee the eventual realization of unlimited [maximum life spans](/), and the recovery, thanks to future advances in biomedical technology, of those whose bodies/brains have been preserved by means of [cryonics](/).

### [Wikipedia: Extropianism](/)


*Extropy*, coined by Tom Bell (T. O. Morrow) in January [1988](/), is defined as the extent of a living or organizational system's [intelligence](/), functional order, vitality, [energy](/), [life](/), [experience](/), and capacity and drive for improvement and growth. *Extropy* expresses a [metaphor](/), rather than serving as a technical term, and so is not simply the opposite of [entropy](/). 

### The Extropy Institute


In [1987](/), Max More moved to Los Angeles from [Oxford University](/) in England, where he had established the first European cryonics organization, known as Mizar Limited (later Alcor UK), to work on his Ph.D. in philosophy at the [University of Southern California](/).

In 1988, "Extropy: The Journal of Transhumanist Thought" was first published. This brought together thinkers with interests in [artificial intelligence](/), nanotechnology, [genetic engineering](/), [life extension](/), [mind uploading|mind transfer|mind uploading](/), Idea Futures, [robotics](/), [space exploration](/), [memetics](/), and the politics and economics of transhumanism. Alternative media organizations soon began reviewing the magazine, and it attracted interest from likeminded thinkers. Later, More and Bell co-founded the Extropy Institute, a [non-profit](/) [501(c)(3)](/) educational organization. "ExI" was formed as a transhumanist networking and information center to use current scientific understanding along with critical and creative thinking to define a small set of principles or values that could help make sense of new capabilities opening up to humanity.

The Extropy Institute's email list was launched in 1991, and in 1992 the institute began producing the first conferences on transhumanism. Affiliate members throughout the world began organizing their own transhumanist groups. Extro Conferences, meetings, parties, on-line debates, and documentaries continue to spread transhumanism to the public. 

The Internet soon became the most fertile breeding ground for people interested in exploring transhumanist ideas, with the availability of websites for such organizations that have joined the Extropy Institute in developing and advocating transhumanist (and related) ideas. These include the [World Transhumanist Association](/), the [Alcor Life Extension Foundation](/), the [Life Extension Foundation](/), [Foresight Institute](/), [Transhumanist Arts & Culture](/), the [Immortality Institute](/), [Betterhumans](/), [Aleph](/) in Sweden, [TransVision](/) in Europe, the [Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence](/), and the [Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies](/).
