# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:829:Eliza's journal entries (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

If these sometimes read like Victorian epistolary novels, and a little bit different from Eliza's usual style, consider that they are actually reconstructions of her encrypted notes written up by Rossignol. So we are seeing things through one and perhaps two layers of "unreliable narrators."
