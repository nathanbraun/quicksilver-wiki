Disinfopedia has changed names. It is now SourceWatch - [http://www.sourcewatch.org/](/http-www-sourcewatch-org)

If you hate liars, you'll like **Disinfopedia**.

An "encyclopedia of propaganda" using the [MediaWiki](/mediawiki) software, it has full dossiers and bios on issues and organizations and people that are lied about, or used to lie through or around. It has also a relatively complete set of definitions of important terms like "standard of evidence", "point of view", etc., and is entirely [GFDL](/gfdl) so any of its text can be copied here.

It will probably eventually stress [source attribution](/source-attribution) capabilities of a [wikitext standard](/wikitext-standard).
