### The Nam-shub of Enki


*"I am fairly certain that the information we need is contained within a clay envelope that was excavated from the ancient Sumerian city of Eridu in southern Iraq ten years ago. Eridu was the seat of Enki; in other words, Enki was the local en of Eridu, and the temple of Eridu contained his me,including the nam-shub that we are looking for."  

     "Who excavated this clay envelope?"  

     "The Eridu dig was sponsored entirely by a religious university in Bayview, Texas."  

     "L. Bob Rife's?"  

     "You got it. He created an archaeology department whose sole function was to dig up the city of Eridu, locate the temple where Enki stored all of his me, and take it all home. L. Bob Rife wanted to reverse-engineer the skills that Enki possessed; by analyzing Enki's me, he wanted to create his very own neurolinguistic hackers, who could write new me that would become the ground rules, the program, for the new society that Rife wants to create."  

     "But among these me is a copy of the nam-shub of Enki," Ng says, "which is dangerous to Rife's plan."  

     "Right. He wanted that tablet, too - not to analyze but to keep to himself, so no one could use it against him."  

     "If you can obtain a copy of this nam-shub," Ng says, "what effect would it have?"  

     "If we could transmit the nam-shub of Enki to all of the en on the Raft, they would relay it to all of the Raft people. It would jam their mother-tongue neurons and prevent Rife from programming them with new me," Hiro says. "But we really need to get this done before [The Raft](/the-raft) breaks up - before the Refus all come ashore. Rife talks to his en through a central transmitter on the Enterprise, which I take to be a fairly short-range, line-of-sight type of thing. Pretty soon he'll use this system to distribute a big me that will cause all the Refus to come ashore as a unified army with coordinated marching orders. In other words, the Raft will break up, and after that it won't be possible to reach all of these people anymore with a single transmission. So we have to do it as soon as possible."*
