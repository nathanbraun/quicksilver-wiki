### Minerva in brief


**Minerva** was a Goddess in Roman mythology. Her name may have originally meant "thought". Minerva was the daughter of Jupiter and Juno. She was considered to be the virgin goddess of warriors, poetry, medicine, wisdom, commerce, crafts, and the inventor of music. She was the equivalent of the Greek goddess [Athena](/athena) (more details can be found there). As Minerva Medica, she was the goddess of medicine and doctors. She may be based on the Etruscan Menrva.

Ovid called her the "goddess of a thousand works." Minerva was worshipped throughout Italy, though only in Rome did she take on a warlike character. Minerva is usually depicted wearing a coat of mail and a helmet, and carrying a spear. The Romans celebrated her worship from March 19 to 23 during the Quinquatria, the artisans' holiday and a lesser version, the Quinquatrus was held on June 13. Minerva was worshipped on the Capitoline Hill as one of the Capitoline Triad along with Jupiter and Juno.
