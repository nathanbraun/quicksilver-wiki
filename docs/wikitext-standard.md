# Wikitext standard

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

*This page is open for anyone to edit and improve.*

A **wikitext standard** would let different [wiki software](/wiki-software) suites - including [offline readers](/offline-reader) or full [offline clients](/offline-client) and [text corpus software](/text-corpus-software) - read the [open content](/open-content) of this and other webs.

There is [an effort towards this starting at Meta-Wikipedia](/http-meta-wikipedia-org-wiki-wikitext-standard). This may eventually relieve the dependence on [mediawiki](/mediawiki) and let other suites such as [tikiwiki](/tikiwiki) or [MoinMoinWiki](/moinmoinwiki) be used, or entirely new programs to develop to manipulate the [Metaweb](/metaweb).

See ['linguistic democracy'](/http-meta-wikipedia-org-wiki-linguistic-democracy-in-a-multilingual-project), [wikitext DTD](/http-meta-wikipedia-org-wiki-wikitext-dtd), [Wikipedia DTD](/http-meta-wikipedia-org-wiki-wikipedia-dtd), ['simple ideology of Wikitax'](/http-meta-wikipedia-org-wiki-simple-ideology-of-wikitax), [(wiki) talk media](/http-meta-wikipedia-org-wiki-talk-media), and other comments and proposals linked from there, if you wish to contribute to the Wikipedia-centric discussion.

All-language support is being discussed at [Unilang](/unilang) - see [EU.Unilang.org's wiki](/http-eu-unilang-org-wiki). This may be the most fruitful place to discuss [Unicode](/unicode) and the representation of [pronunciation](/pronunciation) and such.

[Meatball:WikiMarkupStandard](/http-www-usemod-com-cgi-bin-mb-pl-wikimarkupstandard) lists the common sorts of formatting people want to use, the diverse ways of representing that formatting at various wiki, and discussion about which way is "best".

There is an even more strategic discussion on mediawiki features going on at [Consumerium](/consumerium), where [Vibber and Juho have discussed the need for authentication information to be part of the standard](/http-www-consumerium-org-wiki-wiki-phtml-title-user-juxo-chat-gallery-11-10-2003-with-brion). Since Consumerium, a [moral purchasing](/moral-purchasing) project, has more significant needs for authentication than any other mediawiki-based project, it may lead in this regard. Authorship tracking and authentication of the veracity of comments, and group affiliations between authors (in a [faction](/http-consumerium-org-wiki-wiki-phtml-title-faction) will probably have to be state of the art at [Consumerium](/consumerium), given the latter's mission). [Metaweb authentication](/metaweb-authentication) can simply track that - in the meantime, assisting Juho and Brion Vibber in using Consumerium as guinea pig.

Also the [Disinfopedia](/disinfopedia), another mediawiki-based service, is devoted to exposes of [propaganda techniques](/http-disinfopedia-org-wiki-phtml-title-propaganda) and propagandists, will probably set standards for compiling "profiles" of people. It seems likely that at some point that project will come under legal attack, if only for telling the truth. There has been discussion of ['profiler' technology to draft biography](/http-meta-wikipedia-org-wiki-the-first-useful-profiler) at Meta-Wikipedia, but it's not a priority. [Metaweb](/metaweb) would be best off developing standards for source authentication (as also addressed in [simple ideology of Wikitax](/http-meta-wikipedia-org-wiki-simple-ideology-of-wikitax)) and linking all mentions of one particular human body (as per [meta-wikipedia's person DTD proposal](/http-meta-wikipedia-org-wiki-person-dtd)). 

[Wikipedia](/wikipedia) and [Disinfopedia](/disinfopedia) have started to converge on how they represent [dates - Disinfopedia](/http-disinfopedia-org-wiki-phtml-title-disinfopedia-dates) uses a cut-down version of [Wikipedia's standard](/http-wikipedia-org-wiki-wikipedia-date), and doesn't have comprehensive timelines and "year articles", etc.

[The first useful map](/http-meta-wikipedia-org-wiki-the-first-useful-map) generated automatically from Wikipedia's geographic tags is also evidence that it sets standards in the GIS area that will probably be adopted by other mediawiki projects including [Metaweb](/metaweb).

It is also possible that some standards will be set by some other, non-[mediawiki](/mediawiki) project. But at this point, [Wikipedia](/wikipedia) has over 300,000 articles in many languages, so conversion would seem less onerous if it was the base standard, at least for other [mediawiki](/mediawiki) users.

Tracking the projects which have the strictest requirements, and noting discussion at those projects about those requirements (only), seems like the wisest way to track progress towards a **wikitext standard** and associated capabilities like a [wikitext DTD](/wikitext-dtd) - on which a [metaweb DTD](/metaweb-dtd) would be based. Here's a list of leading projects that Metaweb can follow, and the capabilities it should track:

* [Consumerium](/consumerium) (authentication, group affiliations)
* [Disinfopedia](/disinfopedia) (profiling, source validity)
* [Wikipedia](/wikipedia) (standards for dates, times and geography)
