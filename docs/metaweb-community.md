Questions about community.

Is there a **Metaweb Community**? 

If so, is there more than one? If not, how can something really be a "community" if people don't agree on what they agree on? 

Is there a [Metaweb:social contract](/metaweb-social-contract) or constitution? 

What risks do every member of the community agree to take in common? What harms might they suffer together? If none, are they really a community in the sense we physical beings with real bodies understand it?

Some ideas of community:



---



One definition of a [community](/community) is those who accept one version of a story. Another is those who accept a common [glossary](/metaweb-glossary) of important moral and ethical terms. A third is those who live in the same place. A fourth is those who accept some obligations to each other, like in [Neal Stephenson](/neal-stephenson)'s [Reformed Distributed Republic](/reformed-distributed-republic) from *[The Diamond Age](/the-diamond-age)*.
