# Recyclopedia

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

**Recyclopedia** (at [recyclopedia.info](/http-recyclopedia-info)) is a [GetWiki](/getwiki)-based service managing texts mostly within [GFDL text corpus](/gfdl-text-corpus).

Its focus is on activist, social justice and [multiple point of view](/multiple-point-of-view) works that are very similar structurally to those [Metaweb](/metaweb) seeks to solicit.

It further seeks to apply some relatively advanced sociological thinking to [how to organize itself](/metaweb-itself), and this may be of great interest for [Metaweb:policy](/metaweb-policy) and [Metaweb:governance](/metaweb-governance) purposes.
