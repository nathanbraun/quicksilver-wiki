# Stephenson:Neal:Cryptonomicon:301:a NETWORK of data havens...(Andux)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

*"Your concept of data haven is good but has important limits. What if Philipine government shuts down your cable? Or if the good Sultan changes his mind, decides to nationalize your computers, read all the disks? What is needed is not ONE data haven, but a NETWORK of data havens-more robust, just like Internet is more robust than single machine."*

This is presumedly where [CryptNet](/stephenson-neal-the-diamond-age-cryptnet) came from.
