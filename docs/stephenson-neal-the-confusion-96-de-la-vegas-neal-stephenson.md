# Stephenson:Neal:The Confusion:96:de la Vegas (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

The de la Vegas are named in homage to the author of "Confusion de Confusiones" but are otherwise totally fictitious. Likewise, Jacob Gold and Monsieur Wachsmann are completely fabricated, though based on types that would have been recognizable at the time.
