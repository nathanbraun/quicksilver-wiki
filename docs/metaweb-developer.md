### Metaweb developer concerns



* **limiting edits: permissions vs. factions**


"I can imagine an access control system where authors of pages might grant permission to edit to other users or groups. Right now, MediaWiki has no support for this, but it's a feature the metaweb:developers are thinking about. --Pat 14:50, 14 Oct 2003 (PDT)" in [Metaweb:to serve and to protect](/metaweb-to-serve-and-to-protect).

This is not a good direction for a wiki which generally tries to avoid the [permission-based model](/permission-based-model). A better way would be to require very controversial users to join some [metaweb:faction](/metaweb-faction) with the faction as a whole responsible to validate edits as legitimate. This is really just a more controlled and formal way to deal with people doing edits for each other, or cooperating in trolls-nests, or sharing one user account, which they can do in any online system.

### long term platform


Also, [Mediawiki](/http-meta-wikipedia-org-wiki-mediawiki) has many other problems. It is probably not a good long term platform once a [wikitext standard](/http-meta-wikipedia-org-wiki-wikitext-standard) evolves. Put the energy into the standard, and into figuring out how [large public wikis](/large-public-wiki) really operate and how their politics resembles real world policies, parties and all, rather than wasting energy hacking bad PHP code.

Consider [MoinMoin](/http-moin-sourceforge-net) as an option. It is modular and extensible in [Python](/http-www-python-org). It is used by most archgeek wikis. [XML Dumping](/xml-dump) is another good feature that Usemod has that other wikis don't.
