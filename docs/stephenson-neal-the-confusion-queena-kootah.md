### Stephensonia


*I always figured it was more akin to the island of [Sri Lanka](/sri-lanka) or Serendip, which had many names. Others contend it was a fictionalized [Tuvalu](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-tuvalu) with a dash of [Tonga](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-tonga).*

### Queena-Kootah: Treasure Island


Small fictional Sultanate off the coast of [The Philippines](/philippines), the new Sultan of which is [Mr. Foot](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-foot). In the *current* time of [Cryptonomicon](/cryptonomicon) our protagonists know the Sultanate as [Kinakuta](/kinakuta). 

Kinakuta is more accurately a fictional island realm that is organized like Brunei is. It's a small island found between the northernmost point of Borneo & the skinny Philippine island known as Palawan.

It has been confused with [Malabar](/malabar), the domain of Queen Kottakal, which is located on the southern coast of India.
