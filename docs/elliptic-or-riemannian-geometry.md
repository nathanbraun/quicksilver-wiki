### Elliptic or Riemannian geometry



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. 

Elliptic geometry or Riemannian geometry is a non-Euclidean geometry, in which, given a line A and a point B outside A, there exists no line parallel to A passing through B. 

Its simplest model is that of the [Spherical geometry](/spherical-geometry).
