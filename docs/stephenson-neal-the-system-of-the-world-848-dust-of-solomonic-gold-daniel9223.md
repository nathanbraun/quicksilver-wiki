# Stephenson:Neal:The System of the World:848:dust of Solomonic Gold (Daniel9223)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

*Daniel picks up the phial of scarlet fluid and thumbs the cork out of it, then, practically in the same motion, pours the dust of Solomonic Gold into the fluid.*

Surfing around, I found this [ORMUS (White Powder Gold)](/http-www-greatdreams-com-alchemy-htm). Kind of a fun read. The author thankfully tells us "(Note: this introduction does not attempt to cover the whole of the subject of spiritual alchemy.)" Whew! That scare averted, you will find a rambling list of the "process" and a reference to the red liquid (the solution in he {sic} alchemical retort, if digested a certain length of time, will turn into a red elixir, which is called the universal medicine. )

there is a (obligatory) reference to david icke - so beware!
