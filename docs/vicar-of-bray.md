### [The Vicar of Bray](/)


An English folk song dating from the time of [George I](/george-i), which gives a rather neat summary of English religious and political changes over the period of the [Baroque Cycle](/baroque-cycle).

#### Lyrics




```
  In good King Charles's golden days, 
  When Loyalty no harm meant; 
  A Furious High-Church man I was,  
  And so I gain'd Preferment. 
  Unto my Flock I daily Preach'd, 
  Kings are by God appointed, 
  And Damn'd are those who dare resist, 
  Or touch the Lord's Anointed.
 *And this is law, I will maintain* 
 *Unto my Dying Day, Sir.* 
 *That whatsoever King may reign,* 
 *I will be the Vicar of Bray, Sir!*

```


```
  When Royal James possest the crown, 
  And popery grew in fashion; 
  The Penal Law I shouted down, 
  And read the Declaration: 
  The Church of Rome I found would fit 
  Full well my Constitution, 
  And I had been a Jesuit, 
  But for the Revolution. 
 *And this is Law, &c.* 

```


```
  When William our Deliverer came, 
  To heal the Nation's Grievance, 
  I turn'd the Cat in Pan again, 
  And swore to him Allegiance: 
  Old Principles I did revoke, 
  Set conscience at a distance, 
  Passive Obedience is a Joke, 
  A Jest is non-resistance. 
 *And this is Law, &c.* 

```


```
  When Royal Ann became our Queen, 
  Then Church of England's Glory, 
  Another face of things was seen, 
  And I became a Tory: 
  Occasional Conformists base 
  I Damn'd, and Moderation, 
  And thought the Church in danger was, 
  From such Prevarication. 
 *And this is Law, &c.* 

```


```
  When George in Pudding time came o'er, 
  And Moderate Men looked big, Sir, 
  My Principles I chang'd once more, 
  And so became a Whig, Sir.  
  And thus Preferment I procur'd, 
  From our Faith's great Defender  
  And almost every day abjur'd 
  The Pope, and the Pretender. 
 *And this is Law, &c.* 

```


```
  The Illustrious House of Hannover, 
  And Protestant succession, 
  To these I lustily will swear, 
  Whilst they can keep possession: 
  For in my Faith, and Loyalty, 
  I never once will faulter, 
  But George, my lawful king shall be, 
  Except the Times shou'd alter. 
 *And this is Law, &c.* 

```


```
  *Penal Laws* refers to the laws punishing non-Anglicans
  *Declaration* is the Declaration of Indulgence

```

### Explanation



The eponymous Vicar is determined to hold onto his parish no matter who is in charge. He begins as a believer in Divine Right at the time of [Charles II](/charles-ii), is on the verge of becoming a Catholic in the reign of [James II](/james-ii) until the [Glorious Revolution](/glorious-revolution) convinces him to return to Protestantism. Under [Queen Anne](/queen-anne) he takes the side of the upper classes and becomes a Tory, and finally under [George I](/george-i) he adopts a more liberal position as a Whig.

His frequent changes of heart mirror those of [Roger Comstock](/roger-comstock).
