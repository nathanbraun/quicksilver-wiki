[The System of the World](/the-system-of-the-world)'s nod to **pop culture**
### Stephenson


*We already know that Neal Stephenson is not above pop culture references in his period work (see examples below). The literary technique is obvious - they could be anyone, so they might as well be Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones. However, the use of the term "men in black" just six sentences later suggests that this may be an allusion to Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, the stars of the 1997 movie "Men in Black"*

Men in Black is a 1997 science fiction comedy action film directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, starring Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith and Vincent D'Onofrio. The film was based on the comic books of Lowell Cunnningham and featuring the creature animation of Rick Baker .

Spoiler warning: Plot or ending details follow.

A secretive agency, originally part of the government but now apparently a private organization (" the government asks too many questions", explains one character), allows aliens onto the planet and monitors them while here. The movie follows an NYPD officer (Will Smith) as he becomes a part of MiB, and his first major mission. Tommy Lee Jones plays 'K', a senior MiB agent who guides 'J' (the code-name assigned to Smith) as he learns the ropes. 

Representitives of this agency wear sunglasses and dark suits, and appear at UFO landing sites, similar to reported Men In Black . Instead of intimidating or threatening witnesses, the MiB use devices known as Neuralyzers to wipe their memories and suggest more mundane causes to the encounter (or anything else the agents think of). Neuralyzers are typically the size and shape of an oversized pen (although a giant version is seen in the second movie hidden in the Statue of Liberty's torch), and can be set to erase memories as far back as several years. Neuralizers are also used on agents who leave the organization for any reason. The MiB's sunglasses protect them from the effects of the Neuralyzer. 

As a play on this shadowy anonymity, movie posters identified the two principal actors simply as "Mr. Jones" and "Mr. Smith" (two extremely common surnames in English-speaking countries). 

A Bug (an alien species, similar in many ways to a very large cockroach) is trying to steal a tiny galaxy from another alien  whose government is willing to have the earth destroyed rather than let this galaxy fall into the hands of the Bugs. Eventually, the Galaxy is recovered, and K has J neuralyze him so that he can retire. 

An animated television series followed, based closely on the style of the movie. 

The movie sequel Men in Black II or (M.II.B.) was released in summer 2002, which had the memory of Jones' character restored so he could battle new threats alongside his former partner. 

### [Smith and Jones Wikipedia: Alias Smith and Jones](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-alias)


***Alias Smith and Jones*** was a television comedy-western series on ABC from 1971 to 1973, starring Pete Duel and Ben Murphy.

The basic thrust of the series was that two well-meaning outlaws, Hannibal Heyes (played initially by Duel and later by Roger Davis) and Kid Curry, a sharp-shooter played by Murphy, wished to go straight. They were promised a pardon by the state governor on the understanding that they stayed out of trouble for a certain length of time.

In order to avoid capture, the two outlaws used the pseudonyms Joshua Smith and Thaddeus Jones. In almost every episode, they would find themselves with an opportunity to help someone, but at the risk of giving away their true identities. They were also being pursued by a detective from Pinkerton's agency.

When Pete Duel died suddenly, December 31 1971 -- a possible suicide -- an attempt was made to continue the series with another actor, Roger Davis, in the role of Heyes/Smith. The series continued for another year, but never regained its initial popularity.

#### The Young Country


[Alias Smith and Jones](/http-us-imdb-com-title-tt0065381): is actually a reworking of an earlier pilot/movie, called "The Young Country," about con artists in the Old West. It starred Roger Davis AND Pete Duel and was quite good. If it has ever been shown anywhere since its or- iginal ABC network airings(I assume they reran it once)it got by me. Apparently an ABC executive said "Not bad, but make it more like "Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid'" and a Universal studio exec added, "Here's a sort of Paul Newman look-a-like we've got under contract you can use, so lose one of those guys." So Ben Murphy replaced Davis in the second pilot and the rest is history. If you doubt me, note that in "Country" Joan Hackett plays a character called Clementine Hale, the same name given to Sally Field's two-time guest role in the "AS&J" series. It is a shame that Roger Davis is thought of as the guy that flopped as Duel's replacement, because he was very effective in the original.
