# Talk:Ecosystem

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

We can't talk about [Theory of Evolution](/theory-of-evolution) intelligently without the modern notion of [ecosystem](/ecosystem). So, again, *what is the scope of this project?*

We need at least a way to auto-generate wrapper articles that just say "see the Wikipedia" with a link to the parallel article. Or, some better article, the Wikipedia in general has an authority structure that works to strongly encourage 300 articles on every character in Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, and strongly discourage even discussing the ecological model of the Earth's surface.

* Did you need to make pond, lake, forest, and river into links? And you don't think that is annoying to the non-contributing visitor? You could have defined them in their ecosystem context below your article. For example -- my entry on [Noah](/noah) includes how Islam views him as well. If folks are here -- they have the context for advanced ideas. [Sparky](/user-stsparky) 18:44, 2003 Dec 13 (PST)
