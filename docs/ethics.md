**Ethics** are the rules by which one lives a more or less examined life. Modern study of ethics takes in environmental concerns, the debates on abortion, stem cell research and cloning, legal and medical ethics, [Human rights](/human-rights), and so on. The history of the study of Ethics goes back at least as far as [Aristotle](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-83-translated-into-the-analytical-language-alan-sinder), and can be thought of as the study of all forms of morality and the reasoning or (otherwise) behind them.

[Spinoza](/spinoza)'s great work **Ethics** expounded his theories in [metaphysics](/metaphysics), [mereology](/mereology), [psychology](/psychology) and so on - in fact it was essentially a [Theory of Everything](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-theory-of-everything).

The Greeks claim to have coined the word from *Ethos* which meant *Moral Character*. To me that phrase has the same weight as [Leif Ericson](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-leifur-eiríksson) discovered [America](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-vinland) in the year 1000. It ignores a lot. *Proper behavior* has been *carved in stone* since [Code of Hammurabi](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-code-of-hammurabi), but that doesn't take into account traditional oral transmission of laws. A good example would be **[Talmud](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-talmud)** (התלמוד) is considered an authoritative record of rabbinic discussions on Jewish law, ethics, customs, legends and stories. It is a fundamental source of legislation, customs, case histories and moral exhortations. The Talmud comprises two components, the [Mishnah](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-mishnah) and the [Gemara](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-gemara).

* The code is often pointed to as the first example of the legal concept that some laws are so basic as to be beyond the ability of even a king to change. By writing the laws on stone they were immutable and incapable of being changed. This concept lives on in most modern legal systems and has given rise to the term "written in stone".


**Ethics** boil down to the choices an individual make in interacting with others, while **morals** remain defined as group behavior.
