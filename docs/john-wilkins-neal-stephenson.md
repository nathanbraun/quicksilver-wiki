From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

There are already some perfectly good biographies of Wilkins on the Internet. Two of them can be reached from the [MacTutor site](/http-www-gap-dcs-st-and-ac-uk-history-societies-aubrey-html) which also sports biographies of some of other interesting personages of the day.
