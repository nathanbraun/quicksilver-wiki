## Description


Hackworth is a nanotech hacker, an artifex, which is to say a high level nanoengineer capable of managing significant projects involving massive [rod logic](/rod-logic) matrices, [AI](/ai), [ractive](/ractive) interface, long term power supplies, and [mediatronics](/mediatronics).

As the father of [Fiona Hackworth](/fiona-hackworth), he feels a father's obligation to ensure the future of his daughter, and seeks to acquire a counterfeit copy of the [Ladies Illustrated Primer](/ladies-illustrated-primer) for her through use of the services of [Dr. X](/dr-x) and his off-grid personal [matter compiler](/matter-compiler). He thus becomes embroiled in a web of inter-[phyle](/phyle) intrigue that takes him away from his family and puts him on a quest to find [The Alchemist](/the-alchemist) which involves much work on an illicit nanotechnology called [The Seed](/the-seed), which promises to free the people of [The Celestial Kingdom](/the-celestial-kingdom), aka Middle Earth, aka Neo-[Confucian](/confucian) China, from the corrupting influence of western [ki](/ki). This work includes ten years imprisoned among the [Drummers](/drummers), a hive-mind [FOQNE](/foqne).

He is also [King Coyote](/king-coyote) to [Princess Nell](/princess-nell) in her adventures in the [Land Beyond](/land-beyond), and engineers the [Confucian Primer](/confucian-primer) for the quarter million orphaned chinese girls that Dr. X and [Judge Fang](/judge-fang) wish to save. His control over the design allows him to engineer the girls' evolution into the [Mouse Army](/mouse-army) which is on a quest to find Princess Nell, and who will one day pledge fealty to her when they find her and she disenchants them.
