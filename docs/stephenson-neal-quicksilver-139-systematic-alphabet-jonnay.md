From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

See [http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Spring\_2001/ling001/visible\_speech.html](/http-www-ling-upenn-edu-courses-spring_2001-ling001-visible_speech-html) for an example of such a systematic alphabet. (Allthough, this alphabet was developed in the 1800, about 200 years after the fact.)
