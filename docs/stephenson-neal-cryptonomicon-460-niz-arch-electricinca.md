# Stephenson:Neal:Cryptonomicon:460:NIZ-ARCH(Electricinca)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

*One of the divers comes up with a plank from the crate that contained the stacks of gold sheets. It is in very bad shape, and it's still fizzing as gas comes out of it. Fizzing in a way that Randy has no trouble imagining his bones would do ife he made any errors in working out his dive plan. There is some stenciled lettering just barely visible on the wood: NIZ-ARCH.*

It would appear that [Doug Shaftoe](/douglas-macarthur-shaftoe)'s diving crew have recovered the fabled [Leibniz Archive](/stephenson-neal-leibniz-archive) from the sunken submarine [V-Million](/v-million).
