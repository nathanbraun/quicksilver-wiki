# Wiki software

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

**Wiki software** is growing in diversity and scope.

See [http://consumerium.org/wiki/wiki.phtml?title=Wiki\_code](/http-consumerium-org-wiki-wiki-phtml-title-wiki_code)
for a comparative table of different options. ([Consumerium](/consumerium) too is using [Mediawiki](/mediawiki) but is considering moving off it for lack of certain features and lack of easy integration with other hardware they intend to use in the future).

[GetWiki](/getwiki) is probably the best option at the moment considering its [XML](/xml) support and easy integration of [Wikipedia](/wikipedia) articles, both used at [Wikinfo](/wikinfo).
