# Homer:Iliad:79:while we were to be allotted in tens (Patrick Tufts)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

An [Iliad](/homer-iliad) page


*While we were to be allotted in tens ... and each one of our tens chose a man of [Troy](/) to pour wine for it, still there would be many tens without a wine steward*

[Agamemnon](/) is saying "we outnumber the [Trojans](/) by more than ten to one."
