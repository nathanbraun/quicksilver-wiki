**Wikinfo**, formerly the **Internet Encyclopedia**, is a serious attempt at a [multiple point of view](/multiple-point-of-view) encyclopedia. It is more similar to [Metaweb](/metaweb) than [Wikipedia](/wikipedia). It is run by [Fred Bauder](/fred-bauder) and not by [Wikimedia](/wikimedia) - this is considered a *good thing* by most people who know both rather well. Bauder is a trusted and ethical fellow whose observations tend to be pointed. Most innovative is this projects' front end to Wikipedia and its multi-licensing scheme:

"Unless used with permission of the copyright holder under the terms set forth in the article or licensed under a version of the Creative Commons, or some other Open Source License, all text is available under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License. Images, some of which are used under the doctrine of Fair use doctrine or used with permission may not be available."

That is, texts default to the [GFDL text corpus](/gfdl-text-corpus), but can be licensed under the [Creative Commons by-sa](/creative-commons-by-sa) or some other [Creative Commons](/creative-commons) version by the author. This is a rather flexible scheme but perhaps with some untested complexities.
