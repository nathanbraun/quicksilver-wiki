# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:74:wheel by which the ship is steered (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Actually most ships of this day probably didn't have wheels, because it was a relatively recent innovation; but as we'll see in future volumes, [Minerva](/minerva) is ahead of its time in some respects.

### Balanced Ship's Wheel


Modern day Pirates say it was in 1705 that the **[balanced ship's wheel](/http-boston-about-com-library-weekly-blconst006-htm)** replaced the tiller -- likely imported technology of the Indian or Chinese shipbuilders **[1](/http-www-macautourism-gov-mo-english-museums-en-phtml)** -- in use by the **Dutch** and **Porteguese**. It was an improvement from the Mediterranean nao, or carrack -- which would lead to the full-rigged ship that combined frame-first construction, high sides, center-line rudder, and mixed rigs of square and lateen sails. In [Quicksilver](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver), **[Captain van Hoek](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-captain-van-hoek)** was wise to build the [Minerva](/minerva) in India as *Malabar* teak is more rot resistant than oak available in the dockyards of Christiandom.
