* **Algae**: aquatic plants that can clog ponds or streams and allow mosquito larvae to hide from fish and other predators.
* **Arbovirus**: a virus whos life cycle includes transmission by arthropods.
* **Arthropod**: an invertebrate animal with jointed legs and a segmented body (includes flies, [mosquitoes](/mosquitoes), ticks; also centipedes, scorpions, spiders etc.)
* **Autochthonous**: native to a place; not imported; used to describe a disease transmitted by vectors that became infected from a local source.
* **Endemic**: a disease naturally present in certain human or animal populations.
* **Epidemic**: a disease outbreak affecting certain human or animal populations.
* **Enzootic**: a disease naturally present in certain animal populations (sometimes used in contrast with "endemic").
* **Epizootic**: a disease outbreak affecting certain animal populations (sometimes used in contrast with *epidemic*).
* **Host**: a living organism that serves as a blood source for blood-feeding arthropods, or on which a parasite lives.
* **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**: a system for minimizing the impact of vectors and pests by using a variety of control procedures, and decreasing the chemical input to the environment.
* **Intermediate host**: the arthropod carrier of a parasitic organism.
* **Microbial insecticide**: an insecticide made of bacteria whose infection kills insects; a substance produced by bacteria that is lethal to insects.
* **Palpi**: the jointed feelers on each side of the mouth of some arthropods.
* **Pandemic**: A worldwide Epidemic.
* **Probosis**: The straw-like sucking mouthparts of some blood feeding arthropods.
* **Reservoir**: an animal population that normally harbors a disease-causing organism capable of being transmitted to man or other animal populations.
* **Rickettsia**: a group of small bacteria that live inside tissue cells, and are carried by ticks, mites, fleas or lice.
* **Smudge pot**: container used to hold a substance producing dense smoke; used to drive away insects.
* **Ultra Low Volume (ULV)**: a method of insecticide distribution in which a small portion of the compound is fragmented into extremely fine particles for aerial dispersal.
* **Vector**: An arthropod carrier of a disease producing organism. Usually used when part of the organism's natural life cycle takes place in the arthropod (= intermediate host).
* **Vector-borne disease**: A disease carried by arthropod intermediate hosts.
* **Vector control**: Management of organisms that carry disease.
* **Zoonosis**: A disease of animals that may be secondarily transmitted to man.
