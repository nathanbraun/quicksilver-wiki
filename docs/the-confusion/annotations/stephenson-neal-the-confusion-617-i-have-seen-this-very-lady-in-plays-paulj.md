From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

We see here that [Jack Shaftoe](/jack-shaftoe) christened the ship "[Minerva](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-12-minerva-alan-sinder)" at the suggestion of [Enoch Root](/enoch-root). Coincidentally (or not?), [Minerva](/minerva) happens to be the Roman equivalent of the Greek goddess [Athena](/athena), of whom Enoch spoke of so highly in "[Cryptonomicon](/cryptonomicon)."
