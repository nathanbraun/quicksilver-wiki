From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

**Arianism** is a Catholic heresy dating to the 4th Century, denying the divinity of Christ. The doctrine of *Arius*, it describes what the Catholics termed the Son of God to be instead a lesser god, not begotten from the one god, and that the son is unlike the father. *(Note on page 489, Daniel said that Isaac "does not even believe in the Trinity!")*
