From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

This is a placeholder for a page that we should start about [Gemelli Careri](/gemelli-careri). Briefly, he was a Neapolitan lawyer who in the late 1690's circumnavigated the world eastwards and wrote a book about it.

Gemelli Careri's "Giro del Mondo" provides great insight into the workings of the Spanish treasure fleet in the seventeenth century.
