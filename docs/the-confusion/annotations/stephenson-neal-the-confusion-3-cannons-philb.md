# Stephenson:Neal:The Confusion:3:Cannons (PhilB)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Odd that "cannons" is used as the plural of cannon here and throughout the work â€” particularly given the exquisite attention to detail regarding other words and phrases.

*The word "cannon" serves both as the singular and plural of the noun; "cannons" is generally considered incorrect* says [Wikipedia](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-cannon).
