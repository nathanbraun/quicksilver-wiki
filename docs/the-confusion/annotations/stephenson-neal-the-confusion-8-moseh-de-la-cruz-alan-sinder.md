From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

This is [The Confusion](/the-confusion)'s page for **Moseh**.

## Stephensonia


***Moseh** seems to be the prototype New York [Jew](/judaism) for the late 17th Century. We're unsure if he is really a Kahan. On April 20, 1657 - **New Amsterdam** (later to become **New York**) granted freedom of religion to Jews. We can assume his family links to [Avi Halaby](/avi-halaby) via the maternal line.*

## Moseh of the Ten


He delivers his oar-mates to freedom, after many trials and tribulations, with a cunning plan. In that way he is like his namesake - **Moses**. Moseh later explains he is a [converso](/converso).

## Name


*De la Cruz* means "of the Cross": Conversos usually took Christian surnames like "Saint somebody", but a full converso name would have a more Christian baptism name than Moseh.
Anyway it would be *Mois√©s* in Spanish.
Moseh however does not retake a Hebrew surname (*ben his-father*) when he reaches freedom.
