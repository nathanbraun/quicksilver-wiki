# Stephenson:Neal:The Confusion:44:Partry (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Mary Dolores and all of the other Partrys mentioned in these books are wholly fictitious, and not based on any real characters. There were probably many Irish families of this era, however, who went through similar experiences.
