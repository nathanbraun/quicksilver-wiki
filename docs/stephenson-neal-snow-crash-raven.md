**A Possible Raven  
Peter Steele, singer  
Type O Negative**
*Ned Land -- Jules Vernes' harpooner -- is not as cool as Raven. 
      Until a man is twenty-five, he still thinks, every so often, that under the right circumstances he could be the baddest motherfucker in the world. If I moved to a martial-arts monastery in China and studied real hard for ten years. If my family was wiped out by Colombian drug dealers and I swore myself to revenge. If I got a fatal disease, had one year to live, devoted it to wiping out street crime. If I just dropped out and devoted my life to being bad. Hiro used to feel that way, too, but then he ran into Raven. In a way, this is liberating. He no longer has to worry about trying to be the baddest motherfucker in the world. The position is taken. 

In [Cryptonomicon](/cryptonomicon) [Lawrence Waterhouse](/lawrence-waterhouse) imagines Raven-like abilities for his bunkmate ... 
      Waterhouse does not stop to estimate the probability that he, who needs a place to live, should happen along at the exact moment that a room has become available. Cryptanalysts wait for lucky breaks, then exploit them. After the departing soldier has disappeared round the corner, he knocks on the door and introduces himself to the lady. Mrs. McTeague says (to the extent Waterhouse can penetrate her accent) that she likes his looks. She sounds distinctly astonished. It seems clear that the improbability of Waterhouse's having happened upon this vacant room is nothing compared to the improbability of having his looks liked by Mrs. McTeague. Thus, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse joins a small elite group of young men (four in all) whose looks Mrs. McTeague likes. They sleep, two to a room, in the bedrooms where Mrs. McTeague's offspring grew from the brightest and most beautiful children ever born into the finest adults who walk the earth except for the King of England, the General, and Lord Mountbatten. 
     Waterhouse's new roommate is out of town just now, but by glancing over his personal effects, Waterhouse estimates that he is paddling a black kayak from Australia to Yokosuka Naval Base, where he will slip on board a battleship and silently kill its entire crew with his bare hands before doing an Olympic-qualifying dive into the bay, punching out a few sharks, climbing back into his kayak and paddling back to Australia for a beer. 
     The next morning, at breakfast, he meets the fellows in the next room: a redheaded British naval officer who shows all the earmarks of working at Central Bureau, and a fellow named Hale, whose nationality cannot be pegged because he's not in uniform and he's too hung over to speak. ...*

### Snow Crash's Raven

 
Dmitri "Raven" Ravinoff is a character from [Snow Crash](/stephenson-neal-snow-crash).

Raven is a huge guy of tribal heritage, and is considered one of the most dangerous persons in the world, since he carries an atomic bomb in his motorbike's sidecar. The bomb is rigged to his brain, so that it will go off if anything bad happens to him.

He has a descriptive tattoo on his forehead. Raven is involved in a brief dalliance with [YT](/stephenson-neal-snow-crash). He is the archetype for a ***Bad Guy***.

### [Wikipedia: Obsidian](/)


*Obsidian* is a type of naturally occurring glass, produced from volcanoes when the right kind of lava cools rapidly, e.g., by flowing into a body of water . It consists mainly of SiO2 (silicon dioxide), 70% or more. Obsidian is mineral-like, but not a true mineral because it is not crystalline . It is otherwise very similar in composition to granite and rhyolite. It is sometimes classified instead as a mineraloid.

The color of obsidian varies depending on the presence of impurities. Iron and magnesium typically give the obsidian a dark green to black color. The inclusion of small, white, radially clustered crystals of cristobalite in the black glass produce a blotchy or snowflake pattern (snowflake obsidian). It may contain patterns of air bubbles remaining from the lava flow, aligned along layers created as the molten rock was flowing before being cooled. These bubbles can produce interesting effects such as a golden (sheen obsidian) or rainbow sheen (rainbow obsidian). Small nuggets of obsidian that have been naturally rounded and smoothed by wind and water are called "Apache tears." Obsidian is relatively soft with a typical hardness of 5 to 5.5. Its specific gravity is approximately 2.6.

Obsidian is commonly used for ornamental purposes, for it possesses the peculiar property of presenting a different appearance according to the manner in which it is cut. When cut in one direction it is of a beautiful jetty black; when cut across another direction it is glistening gray.

Obsidian was highly valued in certain Stone Age cultures because, like flint, it can be fractured to produce sharp blades or arrow heads. Like all glass and some other types of naturally occurring rocks, obsidian breaks with a characteristic conchoidal fracture. It may also have been polished to create early mirrors.

In Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican obsidian use was extensive and sophisticated with carved and worked obsidian for tools, as well as for decorative objects. The ancient Mesoamericans also made a type of sword with obsidian blades mounted in a wooden body.

Obsidian is currently used in cardiac surgery, as well-crafted obsidian blades have a cutting edge much sharper than high-quality steel surgical scapels. It produces a cleaner cut and less tissue trauma, which translates to faster healing and less scar tissue.

### [Wikipedia:Atlatl aka Spearthrower](/)

 
The **atlatl** is a [weapon](/) that uses [leverage](/) to achieve greater speed in [spear](/)-throwing. It consists of a shaft with a hook, in which the butt of the spear rests. It is held near the far end from the cup, and the spear is thrown by action of upper arm and wrist. Some later improvements on the original design included loops of thong to fit the fingers.

Wooden spears were known at least since the Middle Palaeolithic ([Schöningen](/), [Torralba](/), [Clacton-on-Sea](/) and [Kalambo Falls](/)). They could be used up to distances of about 15 m with enough power to hurt or kill an animal. The atlatl is believed to have been in use since the Upper Palaeolithic (late [Solutrean](/), ca. 18,000-16,000 BCE). Most stratified European finds come from the [Magdalenian](/) (late upper Palaeolithic). In this period, elaborate pieces, often in the form of animals, are common. With a spearthrower, effective distances of up to 30 [m](/meters) could be reached.

In Europe, the atlatl was replaced by the [bow](/) and [arrow](/) in the [Epi-Palaeolithic](/).

The atlatl has been used by early [Native Americans](/) as well. It seems to have been introduced during the immigration across the Bering Land Bridge, a wide section of exposed seabed that connected Asia and North America during the last Ice Age. The word atlatl is derived from a [Nahuatl](/) (the [Aztec](/) language) word for spearthrower. The Aztecs used spearthrowers in warfare. Inuit and the tribes of the Northwest Coast utilized them in historical times as well. Complete wooden spearthrowers have been found on dry sites in the western USA, and as waterlogged environments in Florida and Washington State.

The people of New Guinea and [Australian Aborigines](/) used spearthrowers as well. The common name on Australia is given as *[woomera](/)*.

In modern times, some people have resurrected the spearthrower for [WikiPedia:sports](/), throwing either for distance and/or for accuracy. Throws of almost [260](/) m (850 ft.) have been recorded. There are numerous tournaments, with spears and spearthrowers built with both ancient and with modern materials.

### [Wikipedia: Aleut](/)

 
The **Aleuts** (self-denomination: **Unangan**) are the [indigenous people](/) of the [Aleutian Islands](/) of [WikiPedia:Alaska](/).

The homeland of the Aleuts includes the Aleutian Islands, the [WikiPedia:Pribilof Islands](/), the [WikiPedia:Shumagin Islands](/), and the far western part of the [WikiPedia:Alaska Peninsula](/).

Aleuts constructed *barabaras*, partially underground houses that functioned well, as Lillie McGarvey, a 20th-century Aleut leader, wrote “keeping occupants dry from the frequent rains, warm at all times, and snugly sheltered from the high winds peculiar to the area”.

[Hunting](/), [weapon](/)-making, [boat](/) building, and weaving are some of the traditional arts of the Aleuts. [19th-century](/) craftsmen were famed for their ornate wooden hunting hats, which feature elaborate and colorful designs and may be trimmed with [sea lion](/) [whiskers](/), feathers, and [ivory](/). Aleut seamstresses created finely stitched waterproof [parkas](/) from [seal](/) gut, and some women still master the skill of [weaving](/) fine baskets from [rye](/) and beach [grass](/).

After the arrival of [missionaries](/) in the late [18th century](/), many Aleuts became [Christians](/christianity) by joining the [Russian Orthodox Church](/). One of the earliest [Christian](/christianity) martyrs in [North America](/) was Saint [Peter the Aleut](/), who was killed in [San Francisco](/), [California](/) in [1815](/) because he would not abandon his faith.

It has been stated that before the advent of the [Russians](/) there were 25,000 Aleuts on the archipelago, but that the barbarities of the traders and foreign diseases eventually reduced the population to one-tenth of this number. Further declines led to a [1910](/) [WikiPedia:Census](/) count of 1491 Aleuts.

In [1942](/) Japanese forces occupied [Attu](/) and [Kiska](/) Islands in the western Aleutians, and later transported captive Attu Islanders to [Hokkaido](/), where they were held as [POWs](/). Hundreds more Aleuts from the western chain and the Pribilofs were evacuated by the United States government during [World War II](/) and placed in internment camps in southeast Alaska, where many died. The [Aleut Restitution Act of 1988](/) was an attempt by [United States Congress](/) to compensate the survivors.

The [Aleut language](/) is in the family called [Eskimo-Aleut languages](/). It is related to the [Inuit](/) and [Yupik](/) languages spoken by the [Eskimo](/). It has no known wider affiliation, but supporters of the [Nostratic](/) hypothesis sometimes include it as Nostratic.
