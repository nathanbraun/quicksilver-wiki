# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:114:Hooke approaches (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

By this point [Hooke's](/robert-hooke) Micrographia had been
published, but just barely (1685). Most of what we see Hooke working
on and thinking about here comes from Micrographia, as if he were
writing the book while at Epsom.
