### Stephensonia


*Young [Ben Franklin](/ben-franklin)'s defense of Doctor [Waterhouse](/daniel-waterhouse) earns an unvoiced **Oh Dear!** from an omniscient-ish narrator from the **[Enoch Root](/enoch-root)** and **[Daniel Waterhouse](/daniel-waterhouse)** bits in the present of 1713. **The King of the Vagabonds** reads like a picaresque novel. And the Eliza bits read like a classic epistolary novel but spiced up a notch with hidden [ciphers](/french-diplomatic-ciphers), [encodings](/wilkins-cipher) or [technical tricks](/the-grille) we've no access to. **[Cryptonomicon](/cryptonomicon)** displayed Neal's grasp of [Len Deighton](/http-www-algonet-se-kallman-books-deighton-htm)'s thriller skills, and the **[Baroque Cycle](/baroque-cycle)'s [Quicksilver](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver)** and **[The Confusion](/the-confusion)** may do the same for [George MacDonald Fraser](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-george-macdonald-fraser).*

### [Wikipedia: Literary Technique](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-literary-technique)


**Literary technique**, also called **literary device**. Novels and short stories do not simply come from nowhere. Usually the author employs some general literary technique as a framework for artistic work. 

#### Annotated List of Literary Techniques


* [Author surrogate](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-author-surrogate), a character who acts as the author's spokesman.
* [Autobiographical novel](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-autobiographical-novel), tales of the author's life as seen by the author in fictional form; sometimes significant changes are made. An example is [James Joyce](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-james-joyce)'s *[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-a-portrait-of-the-artist-as-a-young-man)*.
* [Breaking the fourth wall](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-fourth-wall) is acknowledging to the reader or audience that what is being presented is [fiction](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-fiction).
* [Constrained writing](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-constrained-writing), in which artificial constraints, such as "no words containing the letter 'e'", are imposed.
* [Epistolary novel](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-epistolary-novel), novel in the form of letters exchanged between the characters. Examples include [Samuel Richardson](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-samuel-richardson)'s *[Pamela](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-pamela)*, [Tobias Smollett](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-tobias-smollett)'s *[Humphry Clinker](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-humphry-clinker)*, [Bram Stoker](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-bram-stoker)'s *[Dracula](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-dracula)*.
* [False documents](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-false-document), fiction written in the form of, or about, apparently real, but actually fake documents. Examples include Robert Graves' *[I, Claudius](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-i-claudius),* a fictional [autobiography](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-autobiography) of the Roman emperor Claudius; and [H.P. Lovecraft](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-h-p-lovecraft)'s *[Necronomicon](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-necronomicon),* a fictional book of evil that appeared frequently in [horror fiction](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-horror-fiction) and [film](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-horror-film), written by both Lovecraft and his admirers.
* [First-person narrative](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-first-person-narrative), the [narrator](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-narrator) tells their own tale.
* [Flashback](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-flashback), general term for altering time sequences, taking characters back to the beginning of the tale, for instance.
* [Frame tale](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-frame-taie), or a story within a story, where a main story is used to organise a series of shorter stories.

Protagonists may be fictional or historical personages, or a combination.
* [Magic realism](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-magic-realism), a form particularly popular in [Latin American](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-latin-american) but not limited to that region, in which events are described realistically, but in a magical haze of strange local customs and beliefs. [Gabriel García Márquez](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-gabriel-garcía-márquez) is a notable author in the style.
* [Narrative](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-narrative), fiction written as if it were related to the reader by a single participant or observer.
* [Omniscient narrator](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-omniscient-narrator), particular form of [narrative](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-narrative) in which the narrator sees and knows all.
* [Parody](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-parody), ridicule by imitation, usually humorous, such as *[MAD Magazine](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-mad-magazine)*.
* [Pastiche](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-pastiche), using forms and styles of another author, generally as an affectionate tribute, such as the many stories featuring [Sherlock Holmes](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-sherlock-holmes) not written by [Arthur Conan Doyle](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-arthur-conan-doyle).
* [Picaresque novel](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-picaresque-novel), episodic recounting of the adventures of a rogue (Spanish *picaro*) on the road, such as *[Tom Jones](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-the-history-of-tom-jones-a-foundling)* or *[Huckleberry Finn](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-huckleberry-finn)*.

* [Satire](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-satire), "An attack on wickedness and folly", as [Samuel Johnson](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-samuel-johnson) called it, such as *[1984](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-nineteen-eighty-four)* or *[Brave New World](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-brave-new-world)*. It doesn't always read necessarily humorous, but often comes across as [gallows humor](/leibniz-and-black-humor-alan-sinder).
* [Stream of consciousness](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-stream-of-consciousness), an attempt to portray all the thoughts and feelings of a character, as in parts of [James Joyce](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-james-joyce) and [Virginia Woolf](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-virginia-woolf).
* [Word play](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-word-play), in which the nature of the words used themselves become part of the work.


Authors also manipulate the language of their works to create a desired response from the reader. This is the realm of the [rhetorical devices](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-rhetorical-device).
