# Traditional Timber Framing:People And Profiles:Len Brackett (Timberbee)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

[Len Brackett](/http-www-eastwindinc-com-index-html) Is a very impressive Builder in a Traditional Japanese Style. His personal story is both interesting and inspiring, as is the work he and his company have produced. If you have an interest in the techniques and forms of Japan, this is a good place to start. He also practices a manner of scribe rule, one that is different from the English, or, the French system. He would be the third pole.
