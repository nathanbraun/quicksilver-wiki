Some from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. 

**Have Spacesuit - Will Travel** is a science fiction novel by Robert A. Heinlein published in 1958.

Clifford *"Kip"* Russell, a high school senior who yearns to go to the moon, enters an advertising-jingle contest winning a second-hand spacesuit. Dejected at first, a real spacesuit still has value. He feels forced to sell it for college tuition. Waiting for as long as he can before abandoning his dreams Kip fixes the suit up Â— dubs it *Oscar*, deciding to take one last walk in the suit in his backyard, he playfully calls out on the radio only to unexpectedly contact a passing spaceship. 
A flying saucer lands, and he's captured by evil aliens! On the moon, he escapes but is recaptured and taken to the alien base on Pluto where his doom seems sure. 

The adventure that follows finds the very fate of Earth in the his hands.

### Imagery


I'd like to think Del Rey Books would allow us to show the cover of the book under fair use -- but here is an image of "Oscar."
