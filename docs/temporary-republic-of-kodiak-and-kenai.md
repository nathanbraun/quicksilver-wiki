*"..sir, are you the former President of the Temporary Republic of Kodiak and Kenai?"  

"I prefer to refer to myself as the President-In-Exile.."  

Hiro tried to avoid rolling his eyes, "Uh, is there somewhere we can talk?"*

## Description



TROKK is apparently a republic that arose following the collapse of the United States government on the Alaskan Islands of Kodiak and Kenai, ostensibly to operate on a temporary basis until the US of A got its shit together again. TROKK was taken over by a group of [Russian Orthodox](/russian-orthodox) refugees with the help of [Raven](/raven), a commandeered Soviet nuclear sub, and one of its nuclear warheads.

Given Alaska's recent history of support for secessionist parties, the possibility of TROKK's future existence is not especially fictional, more like foresight.
