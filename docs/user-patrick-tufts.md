**Patrick Tufts**  

I am a real person based on a fictional character. I am often found at *Applied Minds*, where I work on collaborative software and AI systems with Danny Hillis, Robert Cook, Kurt Bollacker, Tomi Pierce ([User:Tpierce](/user-tpierce)), Darin Wilson ([User:Darin](/user-darin)), Ken Skistimas ([User:Ken](/user-ken)), Ben Drees ([User:Ben](/user-ben)), and Blair Zajac ([User:Blair](/user-blair)).

I'm also one of the people behind the Metaweb. If you have any problems with the site, add a note to [my talk page](/user-talk-patrick-tufts) and I will take a look.

My home page is [[http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~zippy](/http-www-cs-brandeis-edu-zippy)](http-www-cs-brandeis-edu-zippy).
