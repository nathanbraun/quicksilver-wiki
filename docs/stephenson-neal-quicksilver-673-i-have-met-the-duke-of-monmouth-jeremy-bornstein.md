# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:673:I have met the Duke of Monmouth... (Jeremy Bornstein)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

This is a reference to a famous comment made by Lloyd Bentsen to Dan Quayle in the Vice-Presidential debates of 1988:

 **Quayle:** I have as much experience in the Congress as Jack Kennedy did when he sought the presidency.

 **Bentsen:** I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, youÂ’re no Jack Kennedy.
