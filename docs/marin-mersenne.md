# Marin Mersenne

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

I've just been reading an account of a monk, who working with an assistant, borrowed
a cannon from an artillery unit in France. They took the cannon to the middle of a field,
pointed it straight up and fired it. They were puzzled when the cannon ball disappeared
and we can only speculate what might have happened to the ball. This experiment was
the result of a correspondence between an artillery expert and a mathematician. The
object of the experiment was to find evidence that the earth rotated. The mathematician,
Mersenne, known to prime number afficianados, had designed the experiment
incorrectly and the experiment has become known as the stupidest experiment the
artilleryman was ever associated with. This was at a time before he stopped shooting
cannons and started comtemplating wax and derived the "je doute, donc je doute", which
became the "cogito".
