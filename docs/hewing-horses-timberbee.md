# Hewing Horses (Timberbee)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Hewing Horses are a portable solution for the supporting of a log during the layout, scoring, and Hewing process. They generally do Not also serve as platforms for the layout and cutting of the timbers themselves.


In general Hewing Horses have three legs, two at the front (The "Set" of legs), and one at the rear, which is formed by the Body itself. If the logs are to be rolled up the horses, as is typical with the three legged variety, that part of the Body, which meets the Earth, is reduced until it's uppermost surface sits flush on the ground, providing unhindered access when rolling the log up the horse.

The backs of most Horses are notched, in order to provide "Steps" for the logs. The longer, and more gradual the slope, the easier it is to roll the logs up the horses, and the less necessary it is to have steps.   
With a gradual enough slope, the horses may be loaded by a single person. 




One of the more common patterns is; A very deep -- greater than 14", slightly, to Greatly, curved Body, legs received into a single, forward angled notch. 
The legs, in this case, are joined into a single "Plank". Spreaders are fastened near both the top and bottom, to form a single, rigid, unit.

To Assemble the Horses, the uppermost spreader is inserted into the slot within the Body, the two legs passing up, into, grooves, or channels formed by wooden strips, the Horses are now complete. In this pattern, it is weight, alone which secures legs to Body. 

Horses are used in pairs.
