# La Suette Anglaise


Symptoms of the “English sweat” included, chills, consuming fever, delirium, burning thirst, and copious fetid sweat. The onset of the disease was fast and fierce; within twenty-four hours one was either dead or out of danger. For those who survived, convalescence was long and accompanied by dysentery. It is reported that suette anglaise most often struck healthy people rather than the weak, the old, and children. 
The disease first appeared in the army of Henry VII as it was camped in Wales in 1485. It quickly spread to London and the rest of England. Since the original outbreak was confined to that island the malady was named suette anglaise.
