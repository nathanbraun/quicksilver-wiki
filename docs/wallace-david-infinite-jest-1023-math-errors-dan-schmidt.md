From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Well, this is off the subject, but the math footnote reminds me of one
of the two things that ticks me off about Infinite Jest - the math
isn't very good. Some examples:

(p. 1023-4) discussion of the Mean Value Theorem

Well yeah, he's pretty accurate here (except for a missing integral
sign in the second equation on p. 1024), but the Mean Value Theorem
is just kind of a nice thing for proofs, it doesn't actually help
you calculate anything one bit. I can't see how it would be of the
slightest use in Eschaton calculations.
