From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

This term (also known as "Stuart Restoration" or "English Restoration") refers to the restoration of the British monarchy in 1660, with the ascension to the throne of [Charles II](/charles-ii). He was the eldest son of the previous monarch, [Charles I](/charles-i), who had been beheaded in 1649 for treason--the only British monarch to have been so treated.

In the time between kings, known unsuprisingly as "[the Interregnum](/the-interregnum-neal-stephenson)", England was ruled by [Oliver Cromwell](/oliver-cromwell) as "Lord Protector," and briefly by Cromwell's son [Richard Cromwell](/richard-cromwell).

Further investigation into the Stuart Restoration is likely to be rewarding for the amateur student of history. The Wikipedia entry on the [English Restoration](/http-www-wikipedia-org-wiki-english-restoration) is a good place to start.
