# Welcome, newcomers

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

oddly enough, this page does not seem to exist, or am i mistaken.....
nice touch though, that the introduction might be written by any and every new user for himself.

Perhaps the first question you'll have to ask is whether or not you're a newcomer. Let's assume, for the moment two possibilities:
1. you are
2. you aren't


If you are, then consider that the door has been left open and you can wander in and wreak whatever havoc you want with what you find here. But we hope that what you will do is consider two things:
1. some of the things here represent, historically, things that really happened and if there is any error in them, you can help put things to right.
2. some of the things here are inventions and have some tie to historical things; the inventions should be left alone and if there is a problem in tying them to history, that can be corrected.


If you are not a newcomer, then learn the rules above and get on with the work!
