In the *current* time of [Cryptonomicon](/cryptonomicon) our protagonists know the Sultanate as Kinakuta. In the era of the Baroque Cycle, it was known as [Queena-Kootah](/stephenson-neal-the-confusion-queena-kootah). It's a small island found between the northernmost point of Borneo & the skinny Philippine island known as Palawan.
