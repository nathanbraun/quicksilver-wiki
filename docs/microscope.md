### Community entry: Microscope


A microscope is an instrument for viewing objects that are too small to be seen by the naked eye. The most common type of microscope, and the first to be invented, is the optical microscope. This is an optical instrument containing one or more lenses that produce an enlarged image of the object, and works by refraction (the bending of light). The science of investigating small objects using this instrument is called microscopy. 

Originally invented by [Anton van Leeuwenhoek](/anton-van-leeuwenhoek), improved upon by [Galileo](/galileo-galilei) and [Robert Hooke](/robert-hooke).
