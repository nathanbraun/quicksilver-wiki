# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:170:CABAL (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Charles II really did have a CABAL and it really was an
acronym for the [names of the leading figures](/cabal) (though the word "cabal"
is, of course much older). I have changed the names and the people and
their roles to suit the requirements of this book.
