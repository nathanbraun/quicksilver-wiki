Shouldn't we add the far roaming Barbary Pirates?  


[http://voyer.crosswinds.net/Piratical/pirate%20pages/barbary.htm](/http-voyer-crosswinds-net-piratical-pirate-20pages-barbary-htm) has ton of links ... 

Worth noting for its difference is vis a vis Christendom vs the 'Orient':  

[ISBN 0345430816](/) Tim Powers' The Drawing of the Dark though I *think* Enoch has a bit of Merlin in him.  


Hmm....... [Orientalism](/http-www-emory-edu-english-bahri-orientalism-html). Read [Edward Said](/edward-said) on this!  


External links: [http://www.emory.edu/ENGLISH/Bahri/Orientalism.html](/http-www-emory-edu-english-bahri-orientalism-html)  

[ISBN 039474067X](/) is Said's very classy book, he *now* teaches at Columbia University.  


Actually, he's now dead. But I'm sure that doesn't bar one from being taken seriously. ;-)

In addition we should point out that modern owes a tremendous debt to the Moslems who kept the lights in during the Dark Ages in Europe.

This much preceded the Ottoman era, which many think were the Muslim "dark ages". The Muslims did indeed "keep the lights on" from [Muhammad](/muhammad) to the fall of [Muslim Spain](/muslim-spain). here are some worthy references:

[http://wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Muqadimmah](/http-wikipedia-org-wiki-the_muqadimmah) - [Ibn Khaldun](/ibn-khaldun)'s historical methods book - the idea of 'fair history' really emerges only from Islamic methodology. Same with scientific citation [http://wikipedia.org/wiki/isnad](/http-wikipedia-org-wiki-isnad)

[http://wikipedia.org/wiki/early\_Muslim\_philosophy](/http-wikipedia-org-wiki-early_muslim_philosophy) (best on this issue, links to many specific phenomena)

[http://wikipedia.org/wiki/guild](/http-wikipedia-org-wiki-guild) - outlines the commercial structure that first evolved among Muslims

[http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Asharite](/http-wikipedia-org-wiki-asharite) and [http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutazilite](/http-wikipedia-org-wiki-mutazilite) - the warring schools!

The negative influence of Ottomans was here: [http://wikipedia.org/wiki/fiqh](/http-wikipedia-org-wiki-fiqh)

Most marked was medicine. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early\_Muslim\_medicine](/http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-early_muslim_medicine) - most influentially, [Ibn Sina](/ibn-sina)'s text *[The Canons of Medicine](/the-canons-of-medicine)* was required reading in Europe right up to [The Enlightenment](/the-enlightenment), and any Baroque doctor would know his name and that of [Al-Razi](/al-razi). (Note "Al-" is just Arabic "the", "Ibn" is a Persian form used by Ottomans sometimes and revived in [Iran](/iran), and there are Latin forms of all these names, e.g. Ibn Sina == Avicenna). The circulatory system was well mapped by [Ibn Nafis](/ibn-nafis) (d. [1288](/1288)). [William Harvey](/william-harvey) only took the credit. There are lots of stories like this.

Some also credit [Al-Kindi](/al-kindi) with the essential influence on [Johannes Kepler](/johannes-kepler) and [Isaac Newton](/isaac-newton) in [optics](/optics). Al-Kindi, [Rene Descartes](/rene-descartes) and modern off-mainstream investigators like [Rupert Sheldrake](/rupert-sheldrake) have surprisingly similar ideas about this. The moderating figure is [George Berkeley](/george-berkeley) who was a fierce critic of Kepler and Newton for inventing a whole [ontology](/ontology) based on "what they could see". This was considered radical and extreme at the time and wasn't really accepted until [The Enlightenment](/the-enlightenment) put everything in man's grasp. This was exactly the old Muslim Mutazilite ("philosopher")/Asharite ("engineer") argument in a new form. Some people think the West went wrong at this point. Certain modern Muslims are exploring this: [http://wikipedia.org/wiki/modern\_Islamic\_philosophy](/http-wikipedia-org-wiki-modern_islamic_philosophy) and [http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamization\_of\_knowledge](/http-wikipedia-org-wiki-islamization_of_knowledge)

 Agreed, I was looking at where the intact libraries were. And thinking who benefitted from them.

There were 36 public libraries in [Baghdad](/baghdad) when the [Mongols](/mongol) sacked it in [1258](/1258). And a lot in [Muslim Spain](/muslim-spain) that [Boabdil](/boabdil) refused to risk, by giving up without a fight. [King Ferdinand of Aragon](/king-ferdinand-of-aragon) and [Queen Isabella](/queen-isabella) of course burned a lot of the manuscripts anyway, but some survived.

Also the Irish monks played a major role in gathering up manuscripts and copying them, it was them that actually started the monasteries of Europe. There was NO interest in preserving Greek/Roman learning in the [6th century](/6th-century) to [10th century](/10th-century) in the Church proper. The monastic hierarchy built itself under the guidance of the Irish Celts, many say Druids brought their own traditions in to Christianity in this way, and was only later brought under full Church control. But note: [Martin Luther](/martin-luther) was a monk, not a priest... the Celts got their revenge in the end!
