*"His mother's people were unbelievably peculiar New Mexican crypto-Jews who had been living on mesas, dodging Jesuits, shooting rattlesnakes and eating jimson weed for three hundred years"...*

This refers to [Avi Halaby](/avi-halaby)'s maternal ancestry, and this must be Avi's connection to the Baroque Cycle. When we last see [Moseh](/stephenson-neal-the-confusion-8-moseh-de-la-cruz-alan-sinder), a peculiar crypto-Jew, in [The Confusion](/the-confusion) circa 1700, he's cashed out his share of the Cabal's Plan, and is headed north to New Mexico to get away from the Jesuits of the Spanish Inquisition.
