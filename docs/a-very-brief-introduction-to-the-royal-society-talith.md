# A very brief introduction to the Royal Society (Talith)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

The Royal Society - more formally, The [Royal Society of London for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge](/royal-society-of-london-for-the-improvement-of-natural-knowledge) - was founded in 1660 and granted its Arms in 1663. It is the world's oldest scientific society in continuous existence.

Its Fellowship consists of nationally and internationally eminent scientists, elected by peer review. Elected Fellows are then entitled to use the initials 'FRS' after their name. The Society also provides funding and support for individual researchers, and promotes scientific communication and education within the UK and overseas.
