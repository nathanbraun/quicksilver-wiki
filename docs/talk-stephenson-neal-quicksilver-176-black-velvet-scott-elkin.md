From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

What is the history behind gluing black velvet to a face?

The fashionable of the Restoration period would choose an appropriately sized shaped square, triangle, star, circle or crescents which were cut from black velvet and silk. One then applied these patches to the face and or neck with a glue.Â  They were decorative devices considered to add charm and to make the face more beautiful according to fashion setters; Whereas, other historians think they may have been used to hide ghastly pox scars! Remember some poor souls had lost noses to 'mercury' pox cures. [Sparky](/user-stsparky) 23:55, 6 Nov 2003 (PST)
