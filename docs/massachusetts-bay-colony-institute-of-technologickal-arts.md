### Community entry: Massachusetts Bay Colony Institute of Technologickal Arts


The **Massachusetts Bay Colony Institute of Technologickal Arts** is Neal's romantic fantasy unlike the similarly named real world **Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)** which admitted its first students in 1865, four years after the approval of its founding charter. The event marked the culmination of an extended effort by William Barton Rogers, a distinguished natural scientist, to establish a new kind of independent educational institution relevant to an increasingly industrialized America. Rogers stressed the pragmatic and practicable. He believed that professional competence is best fostered by coupling teaching and research and by focusing attention on real-world problems. Toward this end, he pioneered the development of the teaching laboratory.
