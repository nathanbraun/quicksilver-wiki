# Mark Twain

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Mark Twain was the author of Huckleberry Finn's *nom de plume*. His real name was [Samuel Clemens](/samuel-clemens). His literary pseudonym comes from a signal given by a person measuring how deep the current is under a vessel on the everchanging waters of Mississipi River - "mark twain" (*twain* means 2 and is of the same root as between) was signal for deep water (2 fathoms, or 12 feet).
