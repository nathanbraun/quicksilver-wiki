# Talk:Baroque

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

I agree [Baroque](/baroque) is "that style that deliberately exhausts (or tries to exhaust) its own possibilities, and that borders on self-caricature."

And, I nominate [Wikipedia Itself](/http-wikipedia-org-wiki-wikipedia-itself) as the best current example of a baroque artifact.

It seems to have no reference but itself, no purposes, nor even a statement of which users it serves... all very odd by [Enlightenment](/enlightenment)/[utilitarianism](/utilitarianism) or [Modern](/modern)/[humanism](/humanism) standards. More like [Postmodern](/postmodern)/[feminism](/feminism) really - beauty for sake of beauty, harmony for sake of harmony...?

I second that nomination.

Unsurprising, then, that [Wikipedia](/wikipedia) provides the [best and most intriguing definition of Baroque](/http-wikipedia-org-wiki-baroque) - now reflected in the [Metaweb:communal entry](/metaweb-communal-entry) <-- a term much to be preferred to one that assumes some undefined and vague ["community"](/metaweb-community), since communing can be a process, or a commune can be a place, while a "community" implies [some body](/metaweb-some-body) committed to the view - while the communal entries may be written by [no body](/metaweb-no-body) but only an IP number... and thus not be persons... perhaps bots?
