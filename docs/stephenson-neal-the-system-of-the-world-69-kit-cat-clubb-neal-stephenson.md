# Stephenson:Neal:The System of the World:69:Kit-Cat Clubb (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

The precise location of the original Kit-Cat Clubb is difficult to pin down. Some later accounts speak of a Kit-Cat Clubb that was farther from the city. But it is impossible to believe that the Whig heavyweights of 1714 would travel so far from town just to go to their club. It must have been somewhere more convenient. I have chosen to place it as described in these pages.
