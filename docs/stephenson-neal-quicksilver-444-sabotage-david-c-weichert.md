From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

[Jack Shaftoe](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-jack-shaftoe) talks about stalling Doctor [Leibnitz](/gottfried-wilhelm-von-leibniz)' machinery by means of a ***[sabot](/sabot)*** (wooden shoe worn by French peasents) and actually uses the word *sabotage*. This seems rather a few centuries too early, since: "The word is said to date from a French railway strike of 1910 when workers destroyed the wooden shoes (sabots) that held the rails in place." ([Britannica: Sabot](/http-www-britannica-com-eb-article-eu-66308-tocid-0-query-sabotage-ct)). The word was introduced to the German Language (according to Duden, Vol. 7, Herkunftsw√∂rterbuch {etymological dictionary}) only in the 20th century. Also in English the word is said to be used only after 1910 ([http://www.etymonline.com/s1etym.htm)](/http-www-etymonline-com-s1etym-htm). The story of workers throwing shoes into machinery is not believed to be the etymological root of the word.

Actually it's Eliza who mentions the possibility of sabot-dropping, and Leibnitz who uses the term "sabotage" in his response. - Scott Helmke
