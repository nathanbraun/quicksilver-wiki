# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:257:Jeova Sanctus Unus (Professorbikeybike)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

*...many not signed "Isaac Newton" but "Jeova Sanctus Unus" which was the [pseudonym](/pseudonym) Isaac used for Alchemy work.*

True? False?

Whether or not he used this as a [pseudonym](/pseudonym) or not, it would appear that he once constructed a virtual anagram for his name (*Isaacus Neutonus*) in terms of "God's holy one" (*Jeova sanctus unus*). See the [link](/http-www-djerassi-com-calculus-program-html) below.
