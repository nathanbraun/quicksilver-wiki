# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:166:Strange information (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

This phrase "strange information" was employed by me in [Cryptonomicon](/stephenson-neal-cryptonomicon) as homage to Suzanne Vega. It has somewhat taken on a life of its own, and crops up in several places in [Quicksilver](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver). She invented it, not me.

It's from the song "Bad Wisdom" off her 1992 release entitled: **99.9 FÂ°**
