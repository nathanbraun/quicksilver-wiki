# Knee Wall

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Knee wall is a term used to discrib the distance between the Top of the Tie Beam and the Top of the Wall Plate, when that height is well below that of a full story

This term is typically only relevant on the outer walls -- Occurring in the [Eaves](/eaves), never the [Gables](/gables).

The term "Knee Wall" is most commonly associated with "Story-and-a-Half" dwellings, though it is appropriately used in Any structure, of any number of Stories, where applicable. 

The term would not be applicable for a barn, which had no developed loft space atop the Tie Beam, no matter what the distance between the Tie and the Plate actually was.

Should that same structure latter have a floor installed at the level of the Tie, then, it may, or may not, be said to have a knee wall.
