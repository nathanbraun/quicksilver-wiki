### Philip V


From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. 

King Philip V of Spain (1683-1746) was king of Spain from 1700 to 1746, the first of the Bourbon dynasty in Spain. The grandson of Louis XIV of France, he was chosen by the dying Charles II of Spain as his successor. This provoked the War of the Spanish Succession. see [Louis Joseph, Duke of Vend么me](/louis-joseph-duke-of-vend么me) for details on that war.

On January 14, 1724, Philip abdicated the throne to his eldest son, Louis, but resumed it later that year when Louis died of smallpox. 

Philip helped his Bourbon relatives to make territorial gains in the War of the Polish Succession[[1]](/http-en2-wikipedia-org-wiki-war-of-the-polish-succession) and the War of the Austrian Succession[[2]](/http-en2-wikipedia-org-wiki-war-of-the-austrian-succession). During his reign Spain began to recover from the stagnation it had suffered during the twilight of the Habsburg dynasty. Ferdinand VI of Spain, his son by his first queen Maria Luisa of Savoy, succeeded him. 

He had a second wife Elizabeth Farnese, who bore him another succeesor, Charles III of Spain[[3]](/http-en2-wikipedia-org-wiki-charles-iii-of-spain).
