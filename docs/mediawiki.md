(Redirected from [Mediawiki](/mediawiki))

**MediaWiki** is the name of the software [Wikipedia](/wikipedia) developed in [PHP](/php) for its own use, that is now used at [Metaweb](/metaweb), [Disinfopedia](/disinfopedia) and [Consumerium](/consumerium), which use the same [GFDL](/gfdl) license, permitting [text from any of these](/gfdl-text-corpus) to be copied to any other. However, not all mediawiki sites have this advantage, [Wikitravel](/wikitravel) for instance does not.

An improved [XML](/xml)-complaint version called [GetWiki](/getwiki) is used at [Wikinfo](/wikinfo). It is superior in many respects and will probably be more suitable for smaller wikis like [Metaweb](/metaweb) that don't have all the load problems. It uses the same [wikitext standard](/wikitext-standard) as the [mediawiki](/mediawiki) sites and is thus fully compatible with our [Metaweb:intermediate pages](/metaweb-intermediate-page).

Many people confuse MediaWiki software, the [GFDL text corpus](/gfdl-text-corpus), the [Wikipedia](/wikipedia) which is simply a user interface and protocol of accessing and updating the corpus using the software, and further confuse these with the "community" of contributors and editors and censors who edit the text using the MediaWiki software and Wikipedia rules. In order to help sort out the confusion the [Wikimedia](/wikimedia) foundation was formed to deal with the management only of the wikipedia spinoff projects, and direct the upgrades to the software, e.g. adding an [XML dump](/xml-dump) capability to help satisfy the [GFDL](/gfdl).
