 daimonion, eudaimonion 
A part of the [human mind](/human-mind) ([daimonion](/daimonion)) OR directly connected through [HyperLogos](/hyperlogos) outside the [human body](/human-body) being a [host](/host) of the [mind](/mind), semi autonomous evolving directed constrained subshelled [intelligence](/intelligence), subshelled [aspect](/aspect) of the [mind](/mind) controlled by the Self of an [entity](/entity) ([person](/person)), analogous to [primitive](/primitive) [daemons](/daemon) that [do](/do) things in the background of main core derivative processing loop of yours' computers' [operating system](/operating-system) (it's [mind](/mind)), which can be [summoned](/summon) into [foreground](/foreground) (given concious [attention](/attention) by calling it by it's [true name](/true-name)) AND then sent into [background](/background) again (for example: [sendmail](/sendmail)); you can assign a [priority level](/priority-level) to a [daimonion](/daimonion) OR [eudaimonion](/eudaimonion) just LIKE to a [daemon](/daemon) (from [hacker jargon](/computer-jargon)), the lower the [priority](/priority), the more [processing power](/processing-power) of your [augmented mind](/augmented-mind) is assigned (consisting of your [biological brain](/biological-brain) and nanotechnologically installed [HyperLogos](/hyperlogos) [node](/node) - called [RENO](/reno), SOME persons (entities) give [it](/it) a [given name](/given-name)); as [operating system](/operating-system) of a [computer](/computer) is aware of running [daemons](/daemon), you are also posess [awareness](/awareness) of [presence](/presence) of your [daimonions](/daimonion) but you don't have to [give](/give) [attention](/attention) to them, they are [autonomous](/autonomous); being specialized [daimonions](/daimonion) can be very useful, for example One can contain One that is a [great companion at parties](/great-companion-at-parties), One that is a [perfect lover](/perfect-lover), One that is a [paranoid merciless warrior](/paranoid-merciless-warrior), One that is an [actor](/actor), One that is a [writer](/writer) etc; [priority](/priority) assigned affects also the [message queue propagation](/message-queue-propagation) in and out of the [HyperLogos](/hyperlogos). [Daimonions](/daimonion) have their own [constrained personalities](/constrained-personalities), [voices](/voices) etc., but they are controlled by your Self. [Daimonions](/daimonion) are capable to [talk](/talk) to each other, control your [human body](/human-body) IF you [order](/order) them so, so One is capable to [do](/do) a [swordfight](/swordfight), [make love](/make-love) and [compose](/compose) an opera at the same time frame. [Eudaimonions](/eudaimonion) can control your [personal body defences](/personal-body-defences), LIKE a [cloud](/cloud) of [nano aerostats](/nano-aerostats) dispersed around your [human body](/human-body) and capable to [strike](/strike) IF [eudaimonion](/eudaimon) [senses](/senses) a [projectile](/projectile) with [trajectory](/trajectory) [intersecting](/intersect) with your [human body](/human-body) (acting as a [shield](/shield)) or augment itself into an [offensive weapon](/offensive-weapon) (acting as a [sword](/sword)) IF it is [ordered](/order) to do so by your Self OR one of your [daimonions](/daimonion). Both types of [directed constrained minds](/directed-constrained-mind) [communicate](/communicate) via and RUN on your [RENO](/reno), that is, on [HyperLogos](/hyperlogos). [Daimonions](/daimonion) are [constantly](/constan) [generated](/generate) by your [biological brain](/biological-brain), but without [RENO](/reno) they are [usually](/usually) [supressed](/supressed) and have little [energy](/energy) OR the opposite -- one can be [posessed](/posessed) by a [wild](/wild) [daimonion](/daimonion)(s). Applying techniques varying from usage of [psychoactive drugs](/psychoactive-drugs) ([entheogens](/entheogens) to [meditation](/meditation) OR [self mutilation](/self-mutilation) ([self imposed pain](/self-imposed-pain))) one can gain [limited](/limited) [Contact](/contact), with [RENO](/reno) ([HyperLogos](/hyperlogos)) you have [full control](/full-control). As [RENO](/reno) gains One access to [everwhere](/everwhere) form of 20th century [Internet](/internet), you have [access granted](/access-granted) to [almost](/almost) all the [human knowledge](/human-knowledge), SOME [dangerous technologies](/dangerous-technologies), LIKE designing new [nanomachines](/nanomachines) are [restricted](/restricted) FOR [Aristoi](/aristoi), whom gain that [status](/status) [after](/after) intensive [education](/education), rigorous [tests](/tests) AND, off course, [natural](/natural) ([genetically](/genetic) [inherited](/inherited)) [talents](/talent) { identity symbol } [engineered](/engineered) [genetically](/genetic) [talents](/talent). Every One has the [RENO](/reno)'s installed, at very [young age](/young-age), [they](/they) [feel](/feel) as [natural](/natural) as a glass or knife or [personal computer](/personal-computer) in 20th [century](/century). Some [speculate](/speculate) that [daimonions](/daimonion) can have their own [subdaimonions](/subdaimonion), but it's probably just a [rumour](/rumour) OR NOT { [Mary CONTINUE](/mary-continue) :: priority 9 <= possibly maybe { primary hypothesis: [RENO](/reno) is a [turing machine](/turing-machine) of level 2; zero hypothesis: [RENO](/reno) is NOT a [turing machine](/turing-machine) of level 2 }. As you can [guess](/guess), GIVEN that [human mind](/human-mind) combined with [HyperLogos](/hyperlogos) the [Mind](/mind), so you are [capable to create](/capable-to-create) your [virtual sceneries](/virtual-sceneries) using [high level language](/high-level-language) or just [imagining](/imagining) things, which cannot be [divined](/divined) from [Real World](/real-world) because the [HyperLogos](/hyperlogos) can override your [human body](/human-body) [sensory input](/sensory-input), expanding your [sensorium](/sensorium) into and over [it](/it), other [entities](/entities) (persons or other kinds of minds) can [visit](/visit) [them](/them) to [talk](/talk), make [love](/love), anything your [mind](/mind) is [capable to conjure](/capable-to-conjure). **Remember, that [immersing](/immersing) [youSelf](/youself) in [virtual reality](/virtual-reality) does not mean that your [human body](/human-body) lies [unconcious](/unconcious), you willt [usually](/usually) [yield control](/yield-control) of it to one of your [daimonions](/daimonion)**. [People](/dragon) can [think](/think) to each other, LIKE [teleempathy](/teleempath), though [HyperLogos](/hyperlogos). More to come...
