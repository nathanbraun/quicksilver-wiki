# Metaweb:Call for admin volunteers with MediaWiki experience (Patrick Tufts)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

We've registered a new domain, *quicksilverwiki.com*, and will be moving the server over to this domain soon. We're going to take the site down this Friday, 28 Apr 2006, to prepare for the move, and it may be down for a while to give us a chance to upgrade the server software. If you experience with MediaWiki installations and are willing to volunteer your time to help, send me an email (patrick@metaweb.com) if you're interested. --[Pat](/user-patrick-tufts) 14:10, 25 Apr 2006 (PDT)
