From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

The **binomial theorem** is an important formula about the expansion of powers of sums. Its simplest version reads
![(x+y)^n=\sum_{k=0}^n{n \choose k}x^ky^{n-k}\quad\quad\quad(1)](/web/20060725171703im_/http://www.metaweb.com/wiki/upload/math/075b23417ae9f63bccfb11f721c664da.png)
whenever *n* is any non-negative integer and the numbers
![{n \choose k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}](/web/20060725171703im_/http://www.metaweb.com/wiki/upload/math/c2d02458d8c35f11e465c639ba62f081.png)
are the binomial coefficients. This formula, and the triangular arrangement[1] of the binomial coefficients, are often attributed to [Blaise Pascal](/blaise-pascal) who described them in the 17th century. It was however known long before to Chinese mathematicians.  


The cases *n*=2, *n*=3 and *n*=4 are the ones most commonly used:
(*x* + *y*)2 = *x*2 + 2*xy* + *y*2
(*x* + *y*)3 = *x*3 + 3*x2y* + 3*xy2* + *y*3
(*x* + *y*)4 = *x*4 + 4*x3y* + 6*x2y2* + 4*xy3* + *y*4

Formula (1) is valid for all real or complex numbers *x* and *y*, and more generally for any elements *x* and *y* of a ring as long as *xy* = *yx*.

[Isaac Newton](/isaac-newton) generalized the formula to other exponents by considering an infinite series:

![{(x+y)^r=\sum_{k=0}^\infty {r \choose k} x^k y^{r-k}\quad\quad\quad(2)}](/web/20060725171703im_/http://www.metaweb.com/wiki/upload/math/2d2fbccb1a7cf7682be34a0e809c2c5c.png)

where *r* can be any complex number (in particular *r* can be any real number, not necessarily positive and not necessarily an integer), and the coefficients are given by 
![{r \choose k}=\frac{r(r-1)(r-2)\cdots(r-k+1)}{k!}](/web/20060725171703im_/http://www.metaweb.com/wiki/upload/math/e1cc108c23731fb4798932f7b1d08b38.png)
(which in case *k* = 0 is a product of no numbers at all and therefore equal to 1, and in case *k* = 1 is equal to *r*, as the additional factors (*r* - 1), etc., do not appear in that case).

The sum in (2) converges and the equality is true whenever the real or complex numbers *x* and *y* are "close together" in the sense that the absolute value of *x/y* is less than one.

The geometric series is a special case of (2) where we choose *y* = 1 and *r* = -1.
