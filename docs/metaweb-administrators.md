From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Metaweb **Administrators** are regular users with a few extra editing powers. They can:

* protect an entry from edits by regular users
* move a page
* delete a page
* ban an IP address of a vandal
* run simple queries against the underlying database


If you are interested in becoming an administrator, see [Metaweb:Becoming an administrator](/metaweb-becoming-an-administrator).
