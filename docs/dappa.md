Dappa, physically described in [The Confusion](/the-confusion) only as having "ropy locks of hair", might well have looked like this
***Dappa** (born ca. 1664 in the Niger River delta), a fictional creation of Neal Stephenson, is a African linguist who appears briefly in [Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver) and has a larger part as a member of "[The Ten](/the-ten)" in the *Bonanza* sections of [Stephenson:Neal:The Confusion](/stephenson-neal-the-confusion). He is claimed to be property of [Charles White](/charles-white) in [The System of the World](/the-system-of-the-world) and has [Eliza](/eliza-de-la-zeur) as his publisher and patron.*

The tale of how he came to be a galley slave (in the 1680s) is humorous and apparently common. We first meet him as [Captain Otto van Hoek](/captain-van-hoek)'s first mate on the deck of the [Minerva](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-12-minerva-alan-sinder) in the late autumn of 1713. Dappa has a remarkable gift for learning languages, and has picked up a dozen or more in his lifetime, including several Niger Bend languages (Taureg, and Bantu?), English, French, Dutch, Portuguese, Turkish, Franco (i.e. Sabir), and Tamil (i.e. Malabar). He is scientifically minded and assists [Daniel Waterhouse](/daniel-waterhouse) in determing a very important fact. Earlier (chronologically), he had been a partner in [the Ten](/the-ten) of ex-slaves in *Bonanza*, serving largely as an interpreter.

His background story starts around page 17. He grew up along the [Niger River](/niger-river), in the kingdom of [Dahomey](/dahomey), in [West Africa](/west-africa).

He may also have been one of the Crewmates of Otto Kivistik in Cryptonomicon.
