From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

### Stephensonia


From the chapter entitled "THE CASTLE" in [Cryptonomicon](/cryptonomicon):* The **Encyclopedia Qwghlmiana** had made much use of the definite article  the Town, the Castle, the Hotel, the Pub, the Pier. *

### Sghr


In Neal Stephenson's [Quicksilver](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver) and [Cryptonomicon](/cryptonomicon): a gigantic basaltic rock spire in or near [Qwghlm](/qwghlm). Hard, dense, dark volcanic rock composed chiefly of plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine, and often having a glassy appearance.

The island of [Outer Qwghlm](/outer-qwghlm) is dominated by the ***Three Sghrs***. The seat of the [Qwghlm's Ducal Family](/qwghlm-s-ducal-family-alan-sinder) is on top of the fourth (smallest) Sghr which looks like a hillock in comparison.

The "Zeur" of [Eliza](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-eliza)'s title (Countess of Zeur) is a corruption of the non-native attempts to pronounce this word name.
