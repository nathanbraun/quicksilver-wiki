The **Ottoman Empire** (sometimes referred to in diplomatic circles as the "Sublime Porte" or simply as "the Porte") was a Turkish state that comprised modern [Turkey](/turkey), part of the [Middle East](/middle-east), [North Africa](/north-africa) and [south-eastern Europe](/south-eastern-europe) in the 14th to 20th centuries, established by the Seljuq Turkish tribe of [Söğüt](/söä-üt) in western Anatolia. The Ottoman Empire was among the world's most powerful polities in the 16th and 17th centuries when the countries of Europe felt threatened by its steady advances through the [Balkans](/balkans) towards [Hungary](/hungary) - threatening [Austria](/austria) which it confronted at the [Battle of Vienna](/battle-of-vienna) in [1683](/1683). It was repelled. This marked the furthest extent of its expansion.

The empire began a slow stagnation and decline, culminating in its defeat in, and dismantling after, the Allies in [World War I](/world-war-i). The [Arab Revolt](/arab-revolt) and [Lawrence of Arabia](/lawrence-of-arabia) played a significant role in the liberation of the [Middle East](/middle-east), but the Arabs were denied full autonomy after the war, which led in no small part to today's issues there.
