### Boolean algebra


thanks to Wikipedia

In mathematics and computer science, Boolean algebras, or Boolean lattices, are [algebraic](/algebra) structures which "capture the essence" of the logical operations AND, OR and NOT as well as the set theoretic operations union, intersection and complement. 

They are named after George Boole, an Englishman, who invented them as part of a system of logic in the mid 19th century. Specifically, Boolean algebra was an attempt to use algebraic techniques to deal with expressions in the propositional calculus.
