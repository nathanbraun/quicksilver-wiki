From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

I am another of the engineering minions at *Applied Minds*; I worked with Patrick ([User:Patrick Tufts](/user-patrick-tufts)), Tomi ([User:Tpierce](/user-tpierce)), and Neal ([User:Nealstephenson](/user-nealstephenson)) to set up the first incarnation of the Metaweb site.
