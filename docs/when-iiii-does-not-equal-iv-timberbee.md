# When IIII Does Not Equal IV (Timberbee)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

For some reason, people seem to have a difficult time deciphering the Numbering systems used to Mark  [North American Timber Framed Buildings](/traditional-timberframing-timberbee), and, One aspect, which is, often, Extremely confusing for people is the concept that IIII and IV are Never the same. 

The quickest explanation is that IIII can be read as "4" from any orientation. With a single glance, you know what it is, this is not the case for the number IV, which, and here is where the tough part seems to be, IV can be read as either 4 or 6.

To most people this seems an absurdity. a I before a V simply cannot be mistaken for a I following a V. But, much of it has to do with the way that the numbers were Cut into the timbers in the first place, with a Knife, rather than a chisel.

To cut the I, it is Simply a straight line, you can begin from either the top, or the bottom of the number, and be assured of complete control.

And here is the problem, This isn't the case with the V, which is Easier begun from the Shared Point, the base. So,

**V's are generally drawn Upside-Down.**

And, that's the long and the short of why IIII is Always 4 and IV or VI Always represent 6.

And,
Consistency is why VIIII is 9 and IX or XI is 11.
