# Oslo

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

**Oslo** is the capital of Norway. It was destroyed by fire in 1624, renamed Christiania by the then king Christian IV, and renamed Oslo again in 1924.

In Quicksilver, there is (I think) an error on the map side the front cover - if the map is supposed to be from middle- to late 1600s, Oslo would be named Christiania.
