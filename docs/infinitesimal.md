### Infinitesimal

 
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. 

In [mathematics](/mathematics), an **infinitesimal** is a number greater in **absolute value** than **zero** yet smaller than any **positive real number**. A number *x* ≠ 0 is an infinitesimal *iff* every sum |*x*| + ... + |*x*| of finitely many terms is less than 1, no matter how large the finite number of terms. In that case, 1/*x* is larger than any positive real number. (*iff* is used as an abbreviation for "if and only if").

An infinitesimal is only a notional quantity - there exists no infinitesimal real number. This can be shown using the least upper bound axiom of the real numbers: consider whether the least upper bound *c* of the set of all infinitesimals is or is not an infinitesimal. If it is, then so is 2*c*, contradicting the fact that *c* is an upper bound. It it is not, then neither is *c*/2, contradicting the fact that among all upper bounds, *c* is the least.

The first mathematician to make use of infinitesimals was [Archimedes](/archimedes).

When [Newton](/isaac-newton) and [Leibniz](/gottfried-wilhelm-von-leibniz) developed the [calculus](/calculus), they made use of infinitesimals. A typical argument might go:
 To find the derivative *f* '(*x*) of the function *f*(*x*) = *x*², let d*x* be an infinitesimal. Then f '(*x*) = (*f*(*x*+d*x*)-*f*(*x*))/d*x* = (*x*²+2*x**d*x*+d*x*²-*x*²)/d*x* = 2*x*+d*x* = 2*x*, since d*x* is infinitesimally small. 
This argument, while intuitively appealing, and producing the correct result, is not mathematically rigorous. The use of infinitesimals was attacked as incorrect by [Bishop Berkeley](/george-berkeley) in his work *The analyst: or a discourse addressed to an infidel mathematician*. The fundamental problem is that d*x* is first treated as non-zero (because we divide by it), but then later discarded as if it were zero.

It was not until the second half of the nineteenth century that the calculus was given a formal mathematical foundation by Karl Weierstrass and others using the notion of a limit, which obviates the need to use infinitesimals.

Nevertheless, the use of infinitesimals continues to be convenient for simplifying notation and calculation.

Infinitesimals are legitimate quantities in the [non-standard analysis](/non-standard-analysis) of Abraham Robinson. In this theory, the above computation of the derivative of *f*(*x*) = *x*² can be justified with a minor modification: we have to talk about the *standard part* of the difference quotient, and the standard part of *x* + d*x* is *x*.
