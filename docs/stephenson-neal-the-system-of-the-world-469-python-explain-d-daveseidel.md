# Stephenson:Neal:The System of the World:469:Python explain'd (DaveSeidel)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Is this a sly reference to a modern-day [programming language](/http-www-python-org)?

or perhaps another reference to [Monty Python](/stephenson-neal-the-system-of-the-world-248-never-expected-the-spanish-inquisition-electricinca) or both?

FYI: The language Python was named after Monty Python.
