## Community Entry: First Distributed Republic


An independent [FOQNE](/stephenson-neal-snow-crash-14-41-franchise-organized-quasi-national-entities-mike-lorrey) based on crypto-cash economics.

Presumably the flag represents Jelly Beans, the favorite candy of President Ronald Reagan, who said, "Government isn't the solution, government is the problem."

The First Distributed Republic was founded prior to the events of "[The Great Simoleon Caper](/the-great-simoleon-caper)", but it was not until the conclusion of that story that it had gained its national flag, consisting of a black field filled with multi-colored jellybeans, representing the jellybeans that were estimated to have filled a number of football stadiums as part of the contest that resulted in the Caper. 

The Great Simoleon Caper describes the first great economic battle between the nascent Republic and the lumbering, vicious, and power-mad bureaucracy of the government of the [United States of America](/united-states-of-america), in a war that would eventually result in the devolution of that government and the balkanization of the North American continent into a great [anarcho-capitalist](/anarcho-capitalist) culture.
