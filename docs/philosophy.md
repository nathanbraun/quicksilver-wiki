The word **Philosophy** is from "the love of knowledge" in Greek. [Natural Philosophy](/natural-philosophy) was the term used for the first stirrings of modern science, since the philosophical policy of thorough and logical study was being turned to the physical world rather than to [theology](/theology), for example. Philosophy as it is studied in today's educational institutions is split into, for instance, [metaphysics](/metaphysics), [ethics](/ethics), philosophies of [mathematics](/mathematics) and physics, aesthetics, [epistemology](/epistemology), social, legal, political, environmental, and so on.

Philosophy is clearly not a pie-in-the-sky pure arts subject. [Quantum physics](/quantum-physics), for example, even though already usable mathematically speaking, is hardly understood at all - those working on this problem are philosophers of science by definition.
