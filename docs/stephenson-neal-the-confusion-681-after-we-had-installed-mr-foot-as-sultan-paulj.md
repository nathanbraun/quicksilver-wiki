# Stephenson:Neal:The Confusion:681:after we had installed Mr. Foot as Sultan (PaulJ)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

From "[Cryptonomicon](/cryptonomicon)" (page 316 of the paperback):

*"...The basic vision (or so it seems at first) is that [Kinakuta](/kinakuta) has always been a crossroads, a meeting-place of cultures: the original Malays, Foote and his dynasty of White Sultans..."*

Also, the most luxurious hotel in Kinakuta was called ***Foote Mansion.*** Its bar was called the ***Bomb and Grapnel*** and had a [pirate](/pirates) theme with authentic cannon (page 213 of the largesized UK trade paperback).
