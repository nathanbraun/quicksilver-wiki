**Maastricht**, also spelled **Maestricht**, (population 122,000) is the oldest city of the [Netherlands](/netherlands), and capital of the province of [Limburg](/limburg-province-of-the-netherlands). The city is situated on both sides of the [Meuse](/meuse-river) river (*Maas* in Dutch) in the south-eastern appendix of the Netherlands in between [Belgium](/belgium) and [Germany](/germany). The name of city is derived from its [Latin](/latin) name *Mosae Traiectum* (Meuse-crossing), referring to the bridge founded by the [Romans](/roman-empire) under the reign of [Augustus Caesar](/augustus-caesar).

Institutions located in Maastricht include the [Universiteit Maastricht](/universiteit-maastricht) (Maastricht University) and the [Bonnefanten Museum](/bonnefanten-museum) of art.

To the south of the city is the "mountain" of [St. Pietersberg](/st-pietersberg) which has an old [fort](/fort) and a network of caves within. The caves maintain a constant temperature of 10°C and are a [hibernation](/hibernation) place for [bats](/bat). It is possible to visit the caves at certain times by guided tour.

Maastricht has a [railway](/railway) connection to [Liege (city)](/liege-city), [Belgium](/belgium), as well as northward to [Eindhoven](/eindhoven) and further.

**History**

An early [Christian](/christian) bishopric until the city lost this position to nearby [Liège](/liege-city), Belgium in the 8th century, Maastricht developed in the [Middle Ages](/middle-ages) into a city of dual authority, with both the Prince-Bishopric of [Liège](/liege-city) and the Duchy of [Brabant](/brabant) holding joint sovereignty over the city. The role of the Dukes was occupied by the Dutch [States General](/states-general) from 1632 onwards when the city was taken from the Spanish by [Frederik Hendrik](/frederik-hendrik). This duality remained in force until the conquest and annexation of the city by the French in 1794. After the Napoleonic days, Maastricht became a part of the [United Kingdom of the Netherlands](/united-kingdom-of-the-netherlands) in 1815. When the southern provinces sought independence from the North to form [Belgium](/belgium) in 1830, the garrison in Maastricht remained loyal to the Dutch king and in 1839 the city and the eastern part of Limburg, despite being geographically closer to Belgium, were permanently added to the Netherlands. Because of the resulting eccentric location Maastricht was often more focused on Belgium and Germany than on the rest of the Netherlands, adding to the distinct non-Dutch character of the city.

Maastricht was the first Dutch city to be liberated by American forces in World War II.

In [1992](/1992), the [Maastricht treaty](/maastricht-treaty) was signed here, leading to the creation of the [European Union](/european-union).
