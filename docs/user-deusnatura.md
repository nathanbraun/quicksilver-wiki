From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

I'm butchering "Deus sive Natura" from the [Spinozan](/spinoza) philosophy...
and it's an homage, not self-deification!
I cannot believe in any kind of beard in the sky - but I can appreciate the (multi/uni)verse as a coherent, glorious (if terrifying) and worship-worthy whole. Stephenson books mirror that to me - the flow and tangle of information is included, indeed prioritised, in my world-view.
