From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Descartes' equivalence between [ordinal number](/ordinal-number) and [cardinal number](/cardinal-number), the [continuum hypothesis](/continuum-hypothesis), is not accepted as a necessity in all theories of [philosophy of mathematics](/philosophy-of-mathematics). It is for instance possible to treat [geometry](/geometry) and [algebra](/algebra) as having no connection to each other. A particularly good example of how tenuous is their connection is the field of [combinatorics and optimization](/combinatorics-and-optimization), which emerged only in the [20th century](/20th-century), and which still relies on [graph theory](/graph-theory) projections into [polynomial](/polynomial) forms that are, to say the least, non-obvious to the layman.

[Cogito ergo sum](/cogito-ergo-sum) is possibly the root of this problem, and those of the [Enlightenment](/enlightenment) in general. A [subject-object problem](/subject-object-problem) emerges when one tries to say that any aggressive being that sees and thinks, therefore is, and therefore has a [point of view](/point-of-view) or [perspective](/perspective) that must be taken into account. It's assuming [God's eye view](/god-s-eye-view) to simply assume self as subject, and some "objective" and passive concept as pliant object... 

It was [Martin Heidegger](/martin-heidegger) and [Michel Foucault](/michel-foucault) who challenged this in philosophy and history, and [Thomas Tymoczko](/thomas-tymoczko) and [Imre Lakatos](/imre-lakatos) and to a degree [Hilary Putnam](/hilary-putnam) who challenged it in mathematics itself. It's an extremely important question. It deserves much more than just Neal's note.
