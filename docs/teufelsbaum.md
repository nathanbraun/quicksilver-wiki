### The Devil's Tree


The **Devil's Tree** was another unwanted stray, like [Caroline](/caroline-of-ansbach), that [Sophie](/sophia-of-hanover) has thought worthy of rescue and nurture and so seen fit to bring under her protection. The Teufelsbaum lovingly repays the favor by supporting and sheltering Sophie in her dying moments.

Hated by the local people of the Harz, it was maybe, for Sophie, a creature living by its true nature rather than courtly pretence. This tree has "all the mass and might of a great tree, but the writhing habit of a vine." It's limbs were gnarled like misshapen animals with bark smooth and sinewy as a skin. What was it that rooted Sophie so strongly to the Teufelsbaum?
