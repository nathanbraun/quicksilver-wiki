# Metaweb:Site renaming (Patrick Tufts)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

**Site renaming** by [Patrick Tufts](/user-patrick-tufts)

In the coming weeks, this site will be moving to a new name and, potentially, a new domain as well. The name is changing from *The Metaweb* to the *Quicksilver Wiki*.

One of the results of this change is that we should, once again, have our own domain name for the site. I'll post the new domain here and on the main page when I know more about it. --[Pat](/user-patrick-tufts) 15:45, 14 Mar 2006 (PST)
