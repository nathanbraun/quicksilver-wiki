From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

This is a Metaweb page for *Jews*. 


### Disclaimer


Being Jewish can be a matter of religion, ethnicity, and culture. If you're interested, I'd recommend [Judaism](/judaism) rather than reading this page. This is a discussion as it relates to the [Baroque Cycle](/baroque-cycle) & [Cryptonomicon](/cryptonomicon). [Isaac Newton](/isaac-newton) had some interesting ideas on [Solomon](/stephenson-neal-the-system-of-the-world-609-how-many-wizards-paulj).
