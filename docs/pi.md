### [Excerpt of Wikipedia: π](/)


The mathematical constant **π** (written as "pi" when the Greek letter is not available) is ubiquitous in mathematics and physics. In Euclidean plane geometry, π may be defined as either the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, or as the area of a circle of radiusÂ 1 (the unit circle). Most modern textbooks define π analytically using trigonometric functions, e.g. as the smallest positive x for which sin(x)Â =Â 0, or as twice the smallest positive x for which cos(x)Â =Â 0. All these definitions are equivalent.

Pi is also known as [Archimedes](/archimedes)' constant (not to be confused with Archimedes' number) and Ludolph's number.

The numerical value of π approximated to 64 decimal places (sequence A000796 in OEIS) is:
3.14159 26535 89793 23846 26433 83279 50288 41971 69399 37510 58209 74944 5923
