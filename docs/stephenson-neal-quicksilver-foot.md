# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:Foot

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Enlisted by [Enoch Root](/enoch-root) to watch over [Jack Shaftoe](/jack-shaftoe) during his African bound trading venture (which ends badly); *There may be more to this man*.

Default position in life is being the proprietor of inns named Bomb and Grapnel, former slave of [Barbary pirates](/barbary-pirates) and Sultan of [Queena-Kootah](/stephenson-neal-the-confusion-queena-kootah).

His descendents apparently established the "foote mansion" on [Kinakuta](/kinakuta), as evidenced in [Cryptonomicon](/cryptonomicon).


A "Mr. Foote" appears aboard the Minerva in Book One of Quicksilver. During a conversation between an Irish sailor and a Plymouth whaleboat pirate, Mr. Foote is identified as a rival guncrew's member. Mr. Foote is said to defame an Irish sailor's guncrew's cannon (named "Wapping Wendy") as ("Wayward Wendy"). As guncrewman represents a major demotion from Sultan of Queena-Kootah, it is possible that this Mr. Foote is a relative or descendent, employed as a favor to the original Mr. Foote. As 30 years have passed since the original voyage of [The Ten](/the-ten), it is likely the gun crewman is a son of the original Mr. Foote, who was already a bit old in the earlier era.
