# Many-Worlds Interpretation

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

The many worlds interpretation of Quantum mechanics. 

This is linked to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. As we can never be completely sure where a particle is at any given time, it could theoretically be in any point within the universe. The many worlds interpretation suggests that the particle is everywhere, but just in separate universes, which is how it can appear to be in only one place in this universe. 

In short, so that any event can happen, all other possible events must also occur, and they do so, only in alternative realities.
