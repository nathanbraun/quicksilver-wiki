### Community entry: Morphogenetic field


Various Wiki sources 

The **morphogenetic field** or **morphic resonance** is a name given to a form of [action at a distance](/action-at-a-distance) proposed by [Rupert Sheldrake](/rupert-sheldrake); However, the idea that vision was a two-way process, was held by a great many minds in the past: . The theory states that things of the same "form" tend to "resonate" with each other, so that, for example:
When crystals of a newly synthesized chemical substance, for example a new kind of drug, arise for the first time they have no exact precedent; but as the same compound is crystalized again and again, the crystals should tend to form more readily all over the world, just because they have already formed somewhere else. (*The Presence of the Past*, Sheldrake 1995)
This concept defies, among other things, the theory of special relativity ---- all crystals, all over the universe, regardless of distance in space/time, will be affected.

### The theory of the morphogenetic field


First conceptualized by developmental biologists the morphogenetic field (beginning in the mid-1980's) seems to be accumulating evidence that it is closely linked to the quantum gravitational field:
* A. The field pervades all space
* B. The field interacts with all matter and energy, irrespective of whether or not that matter/energy is magnetically charged; and, most significantly,
* C. The field is what is known mathematically as a Â“symmetric second-rank tensor.


All three properties are characteristic of gravity; and it was proven some years ago that the only self-consistent nonlinear theory of a symmetric second-rank tensor field is, at least at low energies, precisely Einstein's general relativity. Thus, if the evidence for A, B and C becomes validated, we can infer that the morphogenetic field is the quantum counterpart of Einstein's gravitational field.

### Quantum entanglement


[Quantum entanglement](/http-en2-wikipedia-org-wiki-quantum-entanglement) is a more likely actuality than *morphic resonance.* A quantum mechanical phenomenon in which the quantum states of two or more objects have to be described with reference to each other, even though the individual objects may be spatially separated. This leads to correlations between observable physical properties of the systems that are stronger than any classical correlations. As a result, measurements performed on one system may be interpreted as "influencing" other systems entangled with it. However, no information can be transmitted through entanglement. 

Entanglement is one of the properties of quantum mechanics which caused Einstein and others to dislike the theory. In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen formulated the EPR paradox, demonstrating that entanglement makes quantum mechanics a non-local theory. Einstein famously derided entanglement as "spooky action at a distance." 

On the other hand, quantum mechanics was highly successful in producing correct experimental predictions, and the phenomenon of "spooky action" could in fact be observed. Some suggested the existence of unknown microscopic parameters, known as "hidden variables", that were deterministic and obeyed the locality principle, but gave rise to quantum mechanical behavior in the bulk. However, in 1964 Bell showed that the effects of quantum entanglement could be experimentally distinguished from the effects of a broad class of local hidden-variable theories. Subsequent experiments verified the quantum mechanical predictions, and entanglement has now become accepted as a bona fide physical phenomenon. The "Bell inequalities" are described in greater detail in the article EPR paradox.

### Ignoring Sheldrake


Dark matter is known to exist through the gravitational effect it exerts on visible matter in the universe. As our astrophysical experiments become more sophisticated, and our understanding of large gravitational systems (galaxies and clusters of galaxies) grows, we will answer more of the questions. Among those questions is how does quantum gravitation fields work as an exotic fifth force has been proposed by some physicists from time to time, mostly to explain discrepancies between predicted and measured values of the gravitational constant. As of 2003, all of the experiments which seem to indicate a fifth force have been explainable in terms of experimental errors.
