From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

From 26 April 1996:

Thierry Poutrincourt. Well, Poutrincourt is definitely involved with
the AFR, I think (I mentioned some reasons in my previous big message).
Let's look at some quotes:

(p. 674) She [Poutrincourt] wore white sneakers and a Donnay warmup of a deep glowing neutron-blue that clashed hideously with both their caps.

(p. 867) A figure was out there, not under the shleter of the pavilion but sitting in the belachers behind the east Show Courts, leaning back with his elbows on one level and bottom on the next and feet stretched out below, not moving, wearing what seemed to be puffy and bright enough to be a coat, but getting buried by snow, just stitting there. It was impossible to tell the person's age or sex.

(p. 679) `What you want to know, watching juniors at this level,' deLint says, still back on an elbow so his upper body was out of sight and he was just legs and a voice in Steeply's cold ear.

So the coat possibly points to Poutrincourt. DeLint was sitting that
way before, but of course lots of people sit like that.
