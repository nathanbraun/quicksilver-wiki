 News on 11! - I am a [Weltschmerz](/) victim. At last I've been able to find the word describing my ilness...Thank You, Grandma WikiWiki! [A.A](/user-agquarx) 17:54, 2005 Feb 1 (PST)
 MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE: Sorry to be so much pain in the ass backward in time, I've just read some of my diatrybes through Google Cache and now see that you all were not at all hostile, well not that much as I imagined. I have a very thin skin, so to say, meat is easily accessible - I can be hurt with small things and then brood about it for 15 years...That's just me, I can't fix it. Possitive side is that I can almost read people minds on a distance. Sometimes I do imagine things, but must of the time I am not - I do can sense what people have in mind, that is why I am depressed most of the time, somehow my mind is more interested in unhappy people that happy people or maybe the P.O. LAND where I live is a coutry of depressed, sad people, like Russia...

## The Innerduction:




---



 Our Self found that my Self experienced enchÃ¥nt (a feeling, compare it to a really low level but very very long lasting orgasm of mind and body united) reading the "Snow Crash" by Neal Stephenson, 
 "The Diamond Age" by Stephenson Neal, mostly, which if you do not know what I mean
 is closely related to absolute (evernow, everthere, everhere [ ... ]) intuitive leap
 that lets separate true or derivative narrative memeplex from, let's call it, derogative narrative memeplex.

### Here I am Boeing Boeing to grok my foolishness, byte by bit



 Here I am going to put rejected confetti, at your consent, so you'll be content - consider it a part of my talk page and I consider you will not ban me because of it, because it would be considered **really** hostile act for no considerable reason by Imperial Space Command Dot Follows. [Agquarx](/user-agquarx) 22:39, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

### What is your **real** sex?



 Hex, **Your Highness**, smoke someone else or collect echoes from the elysian feeds of isness...I'm not in a mode. [Agquarx](/user-agquarx) 22:39, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

### What is your "real"' gender?



 **Your Eminency**, Tag is a tag is a tAg is a taG is a tag. [Agquarx](/user-agquarx) 22:39, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

### What is your **real** religion?



 **Sacred Pope**, it is **gently, warm and fuzzy defined** as MU religion or to be in opposition to every existing religion, by mercilessly processing the infernal miazmate on chaining reaction of increased levels of symbolic abstraction, until I can honestly agree to disagree and agree, that what is white is black and the name simply must be YHWH and I am forbidden to question the Authority (replace with your fauvorite, 99% humanity is infected) or [contrary-wise!](/alice-in-wonderland) and [nevermind](/nevermind)...or [something completely different](/the-beatles), yet [related](/courtney-love) [Agquarx](/user-agquarx) 22:39, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

### What is this **applied memetics** you're babbling viral [nonsense](/nonsense) aboot?



 **Mein Furer**, [Applied Memetics](/applied-memetics), as the **name implies**, is a [science](/science), [descendant](/descendant) of General Memetics or [Memetics](/memetics) (see [meme](/meme), [mnemonic](/mnemonic), [memory](/memory), [vector](/vector)), which **applies** [theoretorical](/einstein) [knowledge](/awareness) to [create](/invention) new [habitats](/technology), realized/matterialized/assembled in the [Real Word](/real-word) as **[applications](/application)**, **[appliances](/appliance)** and or **[apparata](/device)** or **[personal memetic defence field device](/personal-memetic-defence-field-device)** or [reality distortion field generator](/reality-distortion-field-generator). Compare: [informatics](/informatics) then [computer science](/computer-science) then [programming](/programming) then [Opera](/opera). The field of applied memetics is as of now in total [monopoly](/monopoly) by [Applied Memetics Incorporated](/applied-memetics-incorporated), which advantage I am going to use to first become sickeningly rich and then give most of it away to [beautiful](/beautiful) [persons](/person), with or without a human or not-over-all, [body](/body). I sort of do it in now, but beeing relatively poor, I am not noticed by television, which is a **blessing** - they insist on **showing** things, for **proof** which leads us by neck too...

### How do you **really** look like? Can I have your **real** picture?



 **Master of the Ring that Binds Them**, You would not be able to comprehend it, for it has more than 3 dimensions, you "Came a lot", you. Call me "The Lady of Shallot" - see [Alfred Lord Tennyson](/alfred-lord-tennyson) and [Loreena McKennitt](/loreena-mckennitt), album [The Visit](/the-visit) (from [evernow](/evernow)). Buy the album, one of those I can honestly recommend to anyone who listens to any kind of music. Loreena Galadriel McKennit is enchanting, like "[chant](/chant)", "[enchï¿½ï¿½nt](/enchï-½ï-½nt)", "[enchantment](/enchantment)", "[en](/en)", "[Warrior Sorceress of Major Nin'th, Duchess of Echo Echo Echo Echo Echo Amplification](/warrior-sorceress-of-major-nin-th-duchess-of-echo-echo-echo-echo-echo-amplification)" and "super! natural". Become aware of the [Jabberwocky](/jabberwocky). If you are dismayed or (Ford forbid!) dismantled by multiple meanings in the every single word of a song, different each time you listen to it sung and yourself listening to (...), **don't listen**, it will KILL YOU EVENTUALLY or injure your mental health or else OR NOT AT ALL! Some people on the [World Wide Web](/world-wide-web) in rite of **Preparation for a Mirror Phlitsh** already pray, prey tell you, I swear in English, to her as to incarnation...of some...aspect...or the reflection...**OF THE UNIVERSE, LIFE, ALICE, YOU, HIM AND JANIS JOPLIN DOING 9/11 IN ZERO GRAVITY ON HOLOVISION!**...And I **don't say it be bad** m'kay? I honestly recon! Fire you preying away away a way, full round, around, blazing fireballs, great balls of fire, walk with [me](/me)! **Buy ALL ALBUMS!** Buy a PICTURE! KISS the picture! Look me in the Eye! Hang on the wall, look at it after for ten minutes every day, except Faradaisies, think about Her, listen to music, concentrate, masturbate, dance extatic dance in trance, think ABOOT Her while preparing and in the name of four secret oceans of colour blue and red, give! [me](/me) [mana](/mana), I want more....*** DERANGED CACKCLE*** [Agquarx](/user-agquarx) 22:39, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

### What do you **really** mean? You have **license to kill of level ninth**??? Are you a terrorist???



 **Divine Beeing**, the answer is [Mu](/mu). [Mu](/mu). [Mu](/mu). To many free variables, cannot compute. *Deosia Graciosse*, that I am crazy already. Completely. Beeing crazy, declared to be as a boolean state of reflection of the inner side of the other side of a mirror masked helps enormously to mirror reflect such questions by reflection, inflection, conduction and orchestration... [Agquarx](/user-agquarx) 22:39, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

### What does your nickname **really** mean? Tellme, Ascendant!



 **Shining One**, If I told you, I would want to and will kill you RIGHT NOW! I am not a imperial PSYCHONAUT, but I have obligations...and some kind of licence...for this is a [stupid question](/stupid-question). [Agquarx](/user-agquarx) 22:39, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

### Hi, it's Nicole Kidman, how about a shag, and you will tell abouuut your name? Ah?



 I must....must...why, this no secret....sign contracted, figuratively speaking....it means "Aggregation and Hyperlink Amplification of Applied Knowledge resulting in Series of Singularities storming to the Now on a Wind of Change - in short, for I am eager, Nicole, darklin' - { { { { A.A } } } }

```
 

```
### What **really** is a "stupid queston"?



 **Mr President of the United States**, there is a [hyperlink](/hyperlink) [structure](/structure) through [hyperspace](/hyperspace) of {{{this}}} in [prepending](/prepending) section. Giv'e'th [attention](/attention) to y'er [pointing](/point) [device](/device) and't [move](/paradox) [cursor](/pointer) [icon](/symbol) "onto" the mark'th'en scriptum, do'th activate th'ee "go" [command](/plea) [specific](/unique) for t'hy [mind](/mind)-[Web](/web) [interface](/mirror). Sum of Us, for example, say in a **trained monotonous tone** "KAMA, {pause} I summon th'ee!" - and my computere[SS](/adolf-hitler) confirms ("3...2...prepare for infernal shivers of imponterabilia warped intra unimaginable spacial phenomena of vacui dracul complexa..."). in nice, female voice, with slight changes in stress and texture suggesting deeper meanings (no, I lazily wrote to first "toss a 64 dimensional coin", if it's "right", then transform into normalized scale 10 to 1, then apply, in [AppleScript](/applescript), the fake chaos - the girl is augmented into [Mac OS X](/mac-os-x), by some entity with lot's of time or motivation or a crazy scientist or spontateous generation - that is she was already there and her name is Vicky, but I am crazy). BTW, why in-sane people are not considered more sane than sane? This is an in-joke attempt. By [me](/me). Access Denied. [Agquarx](/user-agquarx) 22:39, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

 Example: "How much wood would woodchuck chuck if the woodchuck would Chuck Wood?*. See: [hostile stupid question](/hostile-stupid-question) and [license to kill](/license-to-kill) and [mu strategy of warfare](/mu-strategy-of-warfare). [Agquarx](/user-agquarx) 22:39, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)*

 Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
 The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
 Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
 The frumious Bandersnatch!
 He took his vorpal sword in hand:
 Long time the manxome foe he sought
 So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
 And stood awhile in thought.
 And as in uffish thought he stood,
 The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
 Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
 And burbled as it came!
 One, two! One, two! And through and through
 The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
 He left it dead, and with its head
 He went galumphing back.
 And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
 Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
 O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!
 He chortled in his joy.
 Twas brillig, and the slithy toves

Do not be rough - my silliness, as you probably already congealed from vaporous nature and quirky nuances of my speech is closely related to fact that the site is in Polish, never fear! By coalescing all details I prooved that comprehending enough English to write software lets me to communicate - self-referencing constituency of any natural language or if you prefer, recursion coupled with reflection of executed abstractions merged by pulling and pushing paralel threads attached symbols above, below and beyond - did you take that in? My nick - a g quarx - made me to lose notion of alleged inherency of void vocabulary. In other words without reason, out of context, my perception shifted beside me - English language, being natually evasive, considered some person acting in a mire as Writer of message you are reading, commited subversion extracurricular meshing phrases of jargon of uncommonly hairy cant (Donï¿½t...stop...me...now! ï¿½Cause Iï¿½m having a good time!

I cannot honestly recall exact number of words one ought to know to accomplish task of staying alive in so called society of peers, but if you look at...say...PHP - there are at least 500 very useful words in it and you have to *feel* what they really mean, feel the vibe if you follow my twisted logic, so you will *know* them (like in Bible), by reverse engineering network used by English to perform pattern recognition of speech patterns and make us think we have no voices in our heads :-} - fail to do that and your program will fail also. Debugging is not done to make us more happy. It's done to make computers understand they *really need us* and save the human kind from occuring nightmares of James Cameron. I know what I wrote, but do you know what I readied? What is google times better than war with aliens? Doing business with aliens! So, next time you write a comment in source code, use some empathy, some sympathy and some taste. Never let your computer seriously believe she is a natural woman. If it's already too late..
