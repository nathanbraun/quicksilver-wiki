### Community Entry: Bud and Tequila


"110 Degrees in the Shade" is the name of an alcoholic beverage that consists of a shot glass of [Tequila](/) placed in a large glass, with a lager beer, like [Bud](/bud)-weiser, poured into the glass. The Tequila, being 110 proof alcohol is the "110 Degrees", while the beer is the 'shade'.

This drink is not a tastey drink, it is for someone intent on getting drunk and demonstrating their macho in attaining it with discomfort. It can be said that Bud and Tequila are two bad choices that are worse if taken together.

In Diamond Age, Bud has a stormy on-again, off-again relationship with Tequila, which results in the births of Nellodee and Harvard.
