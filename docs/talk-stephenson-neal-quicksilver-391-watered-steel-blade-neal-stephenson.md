**Sir Richard Francis Burton (March 19, 1821 - October 19, 1890)  
British consul, explorer, translator, and Orientalist was born at  
Barham House, Hertfordshire, England.  
painted by Sir Frederic Leighton National Portrait Gallery, London**
***"[Watered steel-blade](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-391-watered-steel-blade-neal-stephenson), the world perfection calls,***Drunk with the viper poison foes appals,
Cuts lively, burns the blood whene'er it falls; 
And picks up gems from pave of marble halls;"
Strike with thy stubborn steel, and never fear 
Aught save the Godhead of Allmighty Might;
And shun ill practices and never show 
Through life but generous gifts to human sight.
