### Deductive reasoning


From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. 

Deductive reasoning is the process of reasoning from the general to the specific. Deductive reasoning is supported by deductive logic, for example: 

From general propositions:
* All ravens are black birds.
* For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction

To specific propositions such as:
* This bird is a raven, therefore it is black.
* This billiard ball will move when struck with a cue.


The conclusions of deductive reasoning are as valid as the initial assumption, in contrast to inductive reasoning. In the latter one attempts to get a general truth from some group of specific observations, e.g. all the swans I have seen are white, therefore all swans are white. This is invalid - there do exist some black swans. Deductive reasoning was first described by the ancient Greek philosophers such as [Aristotle](/http-en2-wikipedia-org-wiki-aristotle).
