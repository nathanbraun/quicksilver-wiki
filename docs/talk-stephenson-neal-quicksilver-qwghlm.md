## Pronunciation of Qwghlm



**On this page there is this paragraph:**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Etymology of the word Qwghlm:
Using a bit of deconstruction - and the prosumption that the Author is, in more than one way sired by Thomas Pynchon - one thing becomes un- confused: The origin and the pronounciation of the word Qwghlm was invented at the moment when Eliza was made Duchess of Qwghlm by the Prince of Orange aboard this little Ship with too little room for a Sword or even a dagger.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Although a very entertaining and convincing way to describe the pronunciation of the Island of Qwghlm - I believe that that Island's name appeared quite a bit
in The Cryptonomicon, which was written before Quicksilver. I dont think that Eliza, in Quicksilver, had much to do with naming Qwghlm. Neil, however, may have found inspiration in a real life Eliza for the island's nomenclature.

Just a thought.

Notice that on the standard keyboard, the letters QW are together in the upper left corner, the letters GH are together in the middle and the letters LM are near the bottom right corner. I think QWGHLM is a nod to the keyboard.
