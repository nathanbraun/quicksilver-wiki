### Chapter One: Boston Common: Subhead: Enoch in Boston


Book opens with [Enoch Root](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-enoch-root) observing a hanging of a witch by [Jack Ketch](/jack-ketch) & he worries about being thought a witch himself. A preacher (not indentified as a [Waterhouse](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-waterhouse-family)) takes advantage of a cold wind as eight-year old [Ben](/ben-franklin) spies Enoch, who is thinking of [Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz](/gottfried-wilhelm-von-leibniz) ...

Footnotes:  

1. As Ben reckons Enoch talks like a schoolmaster, the stage is set for part one of a history lesson: Josiah Franklin fled England due to persecution; Puritan Josiah Franklin's father-in-law fled England because of Archbishop Laud. Enoch tells Ben of [Drake Waterhouse](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-drake-waterhouse) without surrendering the family name of the man he's come to America for ...   

2. The Treaties of Utrecht (April 11, 1713) were signed in Utrecht , a city of the United Provinces. Along with the Treaties of Rastatt and Baden, this concluded the War of the Spanish Succession (as well as Queen Anne's War).   


The Treaties of Utrecht confirmed Philip V as the king of Spain, provided that Spain and France remain separate. The Spanish Netherlands, Milan, and Naples were granted to Austria. England was granted possession of the Hudson Bay Territory, Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia. France and the Holy Roman Empire would not settle their differences until 1714, and Spain and Portugal did not cease hostilities until 1715.  


The main provisions of the treaties confirmed that [Louis XIV](/louis-xiv)'s grandson [Philip V](/philip-v) would remain on the throne of Spain, and retain Spain's new world colonies. Many of Spain's other territories were partitioned out among the allied powers. The Emperor received the Spanish Netherlands, the Duchy of Milan, Naples, and Sardinia. The Duke of Savoy received Sicily and some strips of land in Lombardy. The British received Gibraltar and Minorca, which they had captured during the war.   


There were also some colonial provisions pertaining to North America: France recognized British control of the Hudson Bay Territory and Newfoundland and ceded Acadia to the British. France retained Cape Breton Island, the St. Lawrence Islands, and fishing rights off of Newfoundland.
