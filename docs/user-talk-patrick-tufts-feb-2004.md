On the topic of graphics -- they don't load in all browsers. And a "HOW TO UPLOAD GRAPHICS" page is clearly missing. --anon

 Could you tell me more about the graphics problems? I haven't seen this behavior. --[Pat](/user-patrick-tufts) 01:36, 6 Dec 2003 (PST)

 It may be my Safari browser -- but look at the 'borrowed' wiki pictures of [James II](/james-ii) and how I force it to load. [Sparky](/user-stsparky)

Pat? Could you make "Carolus Linnaeus" disambiguous to "Carl Linnaeus?" Archaic Alan [Sparky](/user-stsparky)

 Do you mean that there should be a redirect from Carl Linneaus to Carolus Linnaeus? --[Pat](/user-patrick-tufts) 01:36, 6 Dec 2003 (PST)

nope -- I mean he was not CARL but Carolus; but if someone types CARL or Carolus Linnaeus they end up where they wanted. [Sparky](/user-stsparky) 01:43, 2003 Dec 6 (PST)

 I will create a redirect that links from Carol Linnaeus to the authored article on Carl Linnaeus. Interestingly, a Google search on Linnaeus shows "Carl Linnaeus" as the most popular form on the net, even from Swedish sites. Linnaeus used several different names, depending on the era and forum he was in. --[Pat](/user-patrick-tufts) 12:58, 17 Dec 2003 (PST)

Pat? I think we've a gremlin [Sparky](/user-stsparky) 04:55, 2003 Dec 7 (PST) 

 Please tell me more. What did you see? --[Pat](/user-patrick-tufts) 12:58, 17 Dec 2003 (PST)

 The first gremlin turned out to be a *newbie* -- but I think you've found the vandal. [Sparky](/user-stsparky) 18:36, 2003 Dec 17 (PST)

Pat? can we get **Enoch Root** to work like [Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:Enoch Root](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-enoch-root) as [Daniel Waterhouse](/daniel-waterhouse) does and do the same for all character names -- such as **Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:Jack Shaftoe** we see on the lists of people Dramatis Personae page? [Sparky](/user-stsparky) 01:00, 2003 Dec 12 (PST)

 This is a matter of some metaweb theological debate. I personally prefer flat listings as I think they are easier for users to work with. But others prefer namespaces that show where entries fit into a hierarchical logical structure. There are good reasons for both systems.

 If you would like, just create a redirect from [Enoch Root](/enoch-root) to the more formal [Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:Enoch Root](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-enoch-root). You can see how to do this by looking at the edit help pages. --[Pat](/user-patrick-tufts) 12:58, 17 Dec 2003 (PST)

* Ok. I'll investigate. !! Pat: at [Metaweb:How to start a page](/metaweb-how-to-start-a-page) the redirect info is an empty link!! [Sparky](/user-stsparky) 18:42, 2003 Dec 17 (PST)

Just a quick question (not sure if this is where to put it). I have a piece of fiction to annotate (published in [Horrors of the Z'Bri](/http-www-dp9-com-products-dp9-806-htm)), but it lies in the quasi-legitimate state of roleplaying game fiction. Would annotations for this sort of material still be welcome here? --[Zak](/user-zak-arntson) 14:57, 2003 Dec 17 (PST)

 For the time being, I'd like to stick to more widely known works and annotate those first. I think we need to have a few core books that become well annotated. Then we can branch out into other books and publications. --[66.237.54.130](/user-66-237-54-130) 18:15, 17 Dec 2003 (PST)

 Understood. Thanks for the prompt reply! I'll try and pick a classic from my shelves or go buy those Heinlein books (or ... get my Quicksilver copy back from the borrower). --[Zak](/user-zak-arntson) 9:37, 2003 Dec 18 (PST)
