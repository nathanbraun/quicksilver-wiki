*Don Quixote* is probably the first recognizable [Baroque](/baroque) figure in literature, appearing in [1605](/1605). He is the protagonist of what is widely recognized as the world's first (and some say still the best) modern [novel](/novel), by [Miguel de Cervantes](/miguel-de-cervantes).

From the point of view of [Quicksilver](/quicksilver) and other fictional universes, Quixote is a useful figure for a number of reasons:

* He illustrates the tension of the [Baroque](/baroque) age - the learned elite working from a new paradigm of reason, and the power and people working from the old paradigms, and the tension being quite alienating


* Another author wrote a book on Don Quixote after Cervantes' part I in [1605](/1605), but before his part 2 in [1615](/1615). In part 2, Cervantes makes references to the "Imposter" - as if a real person had impersonated the real Quixote in a real universe, instead of an author plagiarizing Cervantes' fiction. This opens up some interesting possibilities of a universe in which it is not clear if Quixote is real or not.


* Quixote's lady, [Dulcinea](/dulcinea) is a sort of projection in the novel, who becomes real only at the end when a peasant girl accepts the identity, but in the stage version [Man of La Mancha](/man-of-la-mancha) she is real.


* He is indelibly associated with [windmills](/windmill), which are increasingly important.


* He's well out of [copyright](/copyright), making ripoffs quite legal.
