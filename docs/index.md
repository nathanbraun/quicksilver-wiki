# Quicksilver Wiki

This site is a mirror of the original Metaweb/Quicksilver Wiki, which is no
longer online. It's meant to help you follow along while reading the Baroque
Cycle.

A good starting point would be the page (or annotations) for the book in the
series you're reading:

- [Quicksilver](quicksilver) ([annotations](quicksilver/annotations) and [characters](stephenson-neal-quicksilver-list-of-people))
- [The Confusion](the-confusion) ([annotations](the-confusion/annotations) and [characters](stephenson-neal-the-confusion-dramatis-personæ))
- [The System of the World](the-system-of-the-world) ([annotations](the-system-of-the-world/annotations) and [characters](stephenson-neal-the-system-of-the-world-dramatis-personæ))

## The Baroque Cycle and Metaweb

In 2003 [Neal Stephenson](neal-stephenson) published [Quicksilver](quicksilver), the first
novel in his historical fiction series the [Baroque Cycle](stephenson-neal-baroque-cycle.md).

As part of this release, Stephenson set up a [wiki](metaweb-metaweb-introduction-neal-stephenson.md) with annotations and info on
the book. This wiki was edited both by Stephenson and community of readers.
Eventually it covered the second ([The Confusion](the-confusion)) and third
([The System of the World](the-system-of-the-world)) novels, both released in
2004, as well as a few other books[^1].

[^1]:
    Mainly Stephenson books —
    [Cryptonomicon](stephenson-neal-cryptonomicon.md), [The Diamond Age](diamond-age.md), [Snow Crash](stephenson-neal-snow-crash.md) — but also a few [other](wallace-david-infinite-jest.md) [ones](abbey-edward-the-monkey-wrench-gang.md).

The wiki — initially called
[Metaweb](metaweb-metaweb-introduction-neal-stephenson.md) and later the
[Quicksilver Wiki](metaweb-site-renaming-patrick-tufts.md) — was active from
2003 to 2006, but is no longer online except at the Internet Archive, which is
cumbersome to access.

## Reboot

*This* site is a mirror of the original Quicksilver Wiki — scraped from the
Internet Archive, converted into markdown, lightly processed and rendered using
[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

All internal links should work. Some images work.

Unfortunately, most external links *won't* work, even if they're still
active[^2].

[^2]: I accidentally wrecked most of them while parsing the markdown.
Eventually maybe I'll go back to the html and grab them again.

## Disclaimer

This site is unaffiliated with Neal Stephenson and the original Metaweb
project. I get no monetary value from it. I just:

1. like the Baroque Cycle
2. wanted to enhance my experience (re)reading it, and
3. thought others might be in similar situations

## Contributing

While the original Quicksilver Wiki was easy to edit, this version lives in a
Github repository at:

And for now is only editable via pull requests, which you are welcome to make.
