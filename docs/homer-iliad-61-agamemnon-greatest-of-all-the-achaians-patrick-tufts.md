# Homer:Iliad:61:Agamemnon...greatest of all the Achaians (Patrick Tufts)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Achilles is setting up his challenge of Agamemnon. Not only does he say he'll protect the seer from anyone, even Agamemnon, but also that Agamemnon *claims* to be the greatest of all the Achaians (Greeks).
