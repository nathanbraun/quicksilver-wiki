From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

**Globalization** refers to the process that allows us increasing freedom to travel, live and work all over the world, via aircraft, telecommunications and so on. It also implies economic globalization - the spread of huge international conglomerates at the expense of smaller, more local, or even national/governmental organisations, within one global economy. The so-called "anti-globalisation" activists of the 1990s and on are concerned with the aspects of the new global economy that allow companies to run rough-shod over the rights and interests of ordinary people all over the world, in the name of "[free trade](/free-trade)".
