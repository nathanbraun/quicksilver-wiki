# An Email Conversation With a Would-Be Enoch Root

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

## The Start of the Conversation


by [Mike Lorrey](/user-mlorrey)

I had gone to [http://www.societaseruditorum.org|societaseruditorum dot org] and tried a few minor things. A few days later I received the following email in my spam box:

In investigating societaseruditorum.org, I received the following email (which was directed to my spam directory by yahoo, leading me to believe the domain holder is a spammer or is hosted by a company that serves spammers):

I noticed you were knocking at my door. Is there something I can do for you?

I replied, but my reply got bounced...

I'm an editor of Neal Stephenson's www.metaweb.com and was looking into
any real organizations by the name of Societas Eruditorum. Is your
domain associated with eruditorum.org as well?

How is recruitment these days?"

Interesting...

## The Second Incident



Received another note from the elusive Enoch Root at societaseruditorum.org:

You said you were sent to Societas Eruditorum by Metaweb. I wonder how this 
could be. What was your intent? If you will indulge my curiosity, perhaps 
yours may be satisfied also.

```

Enoch

PS The server routing my email suffered a failure shortly after my first
response to you, which you may or may not have received. I apologize if
you attempted but were unable to reply to that email.



Following my prior attempt to email him. I made some page serve requests to his domain, using the filename space as message space, expecting that he seems to check access logs.

## The Third Incident
