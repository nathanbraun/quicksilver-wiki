One definition of [Baroque](/baroque) is as a dissembling and many-sided intellectual attack on the [neoclassical](/neoclassical). It is not yet tied to [any body](/metaweb-any-body) in particular, but is just a sort of "playing the fool" to distract or blunt neoclassical attack on the body.

The [Roman Empire](/roman-empire) under [Marcus Aurelius](/marcus-aurelius), the [Renaissance](/renaissance) especially in [Italy](/italy) as documented in *[The Discourses](/the-discourses)* by [Niccolo Machiavelli](/niccolo-machiavelli), and modern [neoclassical economics](/neoclassical-economics) share very similar assumptions. They were challenged in each age by [Celtic](/celtic), [Baroque](/baroque), and [Gaian](/gaian) perspectives respectively. These have much in common, most notably humour, refocus on [some "body"](/metaweb-some-body) which is not the vague national or racial body of [The Empire](/the-empire), rejection of a common Imperial concept of "[Man](/man)" which may exclude [women](/women), [slaves](/slave), [workers](/worker), [apes](/ape), or whatever a body view might say is valuable but not part of the Empire's [power structure](/power-structure). 

In this view one may see parallels between [Augustine](/augustine) or [Alaric](/alaric) as "the challenger", [Johannes Kepler](/johannes-kepler) and [Diderot](/diderot), and moderns [Michel Foucualt](/michel-foucualt), [George Lakoff](/george-lakoff) and [Jane Goodall](/jane-goodall). In effect all three ages had those who challenged the dominant notions of defining Man and what it meant to defy or to approach [God](/god).

If neoclassical is about focus on a bad goal, then the movements may be about distraction: [Jose Luis Borges](/jose-luis-borges) claims that "the [baroque](/baroque) is the final stage in all art, where art flaunts and squanders its resources." 

The baroque is intellectual, and [Bernhard Shaw](/bernhard-shaw) has said that all [intellectual labor](/intellectual-labor) is inherently humorous. This humor is intentional in the works of [Baltasar Gracian](/baltasar-gracian) but intentional (as, it can be said, is also the case in [Quicksilver](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver)

[Michel Foucault](/michel-foucault) agreed with Borges about the inherent humour of such practices as [classification](/classification). Especially given the unreliability of much history and biography of the time, or at least lingering doubts, it makes sense to list historical and non-historical figures like literary ones on the same list. Many people believed outrageous lies about real people, like [George Psalamanazar](/george-psalamanazar), and there remain doubts about people like [William Shakespeare](/william-shakespeare), and whether they did what people say they did.

The [Renaissance](/renaissance), according to Foucault, focused on [Signs and similitudes](/signs-and-similitudes) - as does today's [neoclassical economics](/neoclassical-economics) - it is not subjective except for those who *define* the signs and [sameness](/sameness).

A **neoclassical philosophy** binds [analogy, reason, identity, difference](/analogy-reason-identity-difference) to elite [professions](/profession), detaching them from the emotional culture, the Church, and the power relations of the nobles... the same dissonance that alienates [Don Quixote](/don-quixote) in [Miguel de Cervantes](/miguel-de-cervantes)' novel.

The [Baroque (Wikipedia)](/http-wikipedia-org-wiki-baroque) can be seen as linguistic and focused on [power structure](/power-structure) and [subject-object problems](/subject-object-problem) arising from the [Reformation](/reformation) and [Counter-Reformation](/counter-reformation), reaction to "the crisis
of Renaissance neoclassical schemes." 

The [neoclassical economics](/neoclassical-economics) of today's [neoliberal](/neoliberal) leads to a [market theology](/market-theology) of [globalization](/globalization). Its idea of "[Man](/man)" has been challenged as being that of [no body](/metaweb-no-body).

The [Copernican](/copernican-revolution) and [Lutheran revolution](/lutheran-revolution) were also searches for a [foundation ontology](/foundation-ontology), as the proof of an [ultimate human power](/ultimate-human-power), at least to impose [the gaze](/the-gaze) of the wise and good [doctor](/doctor) (Foucault), or [Panopticon](/panopticon) of [carceral state](/carceral-state) ([Jeremy Bentham](/jeremy-bentham), Foucualt, and [Steve Mann](/steve-mann))

Alternatives to the neoclassical philosophy expressed in such sources as *[The Economist](/the-economist)* include those of [eco-feminism](/eco-feminism), [eco-villages](/eco-village), a [class war](/class-war) or
[worker's revolution](/worker-s-revolution), an [Islamic revolution](/islamic-revolution) or that of [Green Parties](/green-parties) or [deep ecology](/deep-ecology). These last are interesting due to the parallel origins of [Gaians](/gaian) as per [Buckminster Fuller](/buckminster-fuller) and the [Baroque](/baroque) view:

[Johannes Kepler](/johannes-kepler) had diverse interests and was quite interested in [biology](/biology). Some credit him with the first scientific statement of a [Gaia philosophy](/gaia-philosophy). Kepler's mother was accused of witchcraft - and his own [sacred geometry](/sacred-geometry) of the spheres, which he discarded for the [elliptic orbits](/elliptic-orbit), is a good representation of the shift from earlier magical thinking to modern scientific models. As the very first person to say (according to [Lewis Thomas](/lewis-thomas)) that the entire [Earth](/earth) was one living round organism - the thesis of very much later [Gaia philosophy](/gaia-philosophy) - it might be fair to say that he was first to seriously challenge the **neoclassical philosophy**.

Is history repeating itself? Can it ever do anything else?
