# Talk:Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:1:Those who assume hypotheses... (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

On Newton’s mindset about hypothesizing, Einstein wrote,

“*We now realize, with special clarity, how much in error are those theorists who believe that theory comes inductively from experience. Even the great Newton could not free himself from this error (“Hypotheses non fingo”).*

For which Einstein translates the Latin in a footnote as, “ I make no hypotheses”.
