### Brachistochrone Problem


A challenge posed in 1696 by the [Bernoulli's](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-305-the-bernoullis-jonnay) during [the Priority Dispute](/the-priority-dispute) over the invention of the Calculus. Briefly, the problem is to find the curve between two points such that a particle travelling along that curve under the influence of gravity and free from friction will move from point A to point B in the minimum amount of time.
