Dancing to the feel of the Drum
Leave this World behind
We'll have a drink and toast to ourselfes
Under a violet Moon

Tudor Rose with her Hair in curls
Will make you turn and stare
Try to steal a kiss at the Bridge
Under a violet Moon

Raise your hats and your Glasses too
We will dance the whole Night throught
We're going back to a Time we knew
Under a violet Moon

Cheers to the Knights and Days of olde
the beggars and the thieves
living in an enchanted wood
Under a violet Moon

...

Raise your hats and your Glasses too
We will dance the whole Night throught
We're going back to a Time we knew
Under a violet Moon

Raise your hats and your Glasses too
We will dance the whole Night throught
We're going back to a Time we knew
Under a violet Moon

Close your eyes and lose yourself
In a medievel mood
taste the tresures and sing the lunes
Under a violet Moon

This my delight on a shiny night
the seasons of a year
to keep the lanterns burning bright
Under a violet Moon

Raise your hats and your Glasses too
We will dance the whole Night throught
We're going back to a Time we knew
Under a violet Moon

Raise your hats and your Glasses too
We will dance the whole Night throught
We're going back to a Time we knew
Under a violet Moon

Raise your hats and your Glasses too
We will dance the whole Night throught
We're going back to a Time we knew
Under a violet Moon

Raise your hats and your Glasses too
We will dance the whole Night throught
We're going back to a Time we knew
Under a violet Moon

Raise your hats and your Glasses too
We will dance the whole Night throught
We're going back to a Time we knew
Under a violet Moon

Raise your hats and your Glasses too
We will dance the whole Night throught
We're going back to a Time we knew
Under a violet Under a violet
Under a [violet](/violet)...
