## Mana, a confusing definition



Mana is a magical something which people use up to perform
magickal operarations. It is not energy, it is not radiation nor 
field. It has something to do with quantum mechanics and 
string theory, but I am not sure yet what exacly, so no equations
this time, Scout!

How to power an Icon with mana? Why, it is simple (not really) -
you build Icon Shrines, distribute Icon Merchandise and then
collect. Icon Shrine can be a web page to which you lure as many
fans as possible, give them pictures so they can set them as wallpapers,
anything that will keep their concentration (OK, worship!) on the Icon.
If you have sexually arousing pictures - USE THEM! A fan masturbating
with picture of an Icon is worth 100 times more than a "decent" fan!
Sexual desire is one of the most common and powerful sources of mana.
