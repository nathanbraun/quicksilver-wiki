## Community Entry: Protocol Enforcement



Protocol Enforcement is a specialized [Franchise Operated Quasi-National Entity](/franchise-operated-quasi-national-entities) which operates as a high level agency which provides other sovereign entities both a form of retroactive recursive insurance AND [self-enforcement](/self-enforcement) of contracts under the [Common Economic Protocol](/common-economic-protocol). Enforcement actions can vary from intelligence gathering and other espionage/covert activities, to community policing, up to full fledged combat of various degrees.

Protocol Enforcement is not ostensibly a [final arbiter](/final-arbiter), but enforces the judgements of said final arbiters when parties to a dispute refuse to accede to [arbitration rulings](/arbitration-rulings).
