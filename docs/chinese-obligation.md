### Urban Dictionary: Chinese obligation


[Chinese obligation](/http-www-urbandictionary-com-define-php-term-chinese-obligation-defid-654566): An obligation incurred by helping someone, which requires the helper to continue helping. From the old assumption in the West that the Chinese do everything backwards and upside-down (e.g., "Chinese fire drill," "Chinese auction," etc.).
EG I saved a kitten from a shelter, and now I have this Chinese obligation to raise them.
