# Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:3:Jack Ketch (Neal Stephenson)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

A general-purpose moniker applied to any executioner.

*The manor of Tyburn was formerly held by Richard **Jaquett**, where felons for a long time were executed; from whence we have Jack Ketch.*
**- Lloyd's MS., British Museum.**

This is somewhat anachronistic.
