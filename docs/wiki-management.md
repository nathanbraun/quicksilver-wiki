# Wiki management

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

**Wiki management** is somewhat different from most content management due to lack of a permissions-based model of "who can edit", relying on quick [revert](/revert) instead. Some good discussions on wiki management problems:

* [at Consumerium](/http-consumerium-org-wiki-wiki-phtml-title-wiki-management) - rigorous, as they are facing a very difficult management problem there
* [at C2.com PatternRepositoryWiki](/http-c2-com-cgi-wiki-wikimanagement) - probably the most authoritative source on wikis as such
