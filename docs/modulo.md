# Modulo

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

To add (subtract, etc.) several numbers **modulo** 2, or 3, or any other natural number **n**, is to add (subtract, etc.) as if one is counting around a "clock" face. Imagine the clock has numbers to 7. If one was to point to 2, then add 9 to that, one would arrive at 4. Thus, 2 + 9 **modulo** 7 = 4.
