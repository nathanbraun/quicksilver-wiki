**[Introduction to the Quicksilver Wiki](/metaweb-metaweb-introduction-neal-stephenson)** by Neal Stephenson
Superficially, this site looks like a set of FAQs about a novel that I wrote entitled QUICKSILVER. As time goes on, we hope that it will develop into something a little more than that. We don't know how it will come out. It's an experiment.

Why put the information on such a complicated system, when a simple FAQ is easier? Because we are hoping that the annotations of the book on this site will seed a body of knowledge ... which will eventually be something more generally useful than a list of FAQs about one and only one novel. The idea of the Metaweb was originated by Danny Hillis. [more](/metaweb-metaweb-introduction-neal-stephenson)

We are currently working on 1078 articles. See the community section at the bottom of this page to learn more.

|**[Call for admin volunteers with MediaWiki experience](/metaweb-call-for-admin-volunteers-with-mediawiki-experience-patrick-tufts)** by [Patrick Tufts](/user-patrick-tufts), 25 Apr 2006

 We've registered a new domain, *quicksilverwiki.com*, and will be moving the server over to this domain soon. We're going to take the site down this Friday, 28 Apr 2006, to prepare for the move, and it may be down for a while to give us a chance to upgrade the server software. If you experience with MediaWiki installations and are willing to volunteer your time to help, send me an email (patrick@metaweb.com) if you're interested ...[more](/metaweb-call-for-admin-volunteers-with-mediawiki-experience-patrick-tufts)

**[Site renaming](/metaweb-site-renaming-patrick-tufts)** by [Patrick Tufts](/user-patrick-tufts), 14 Mar 2006
*In the coming weeks, this site will be moving to a new name and, potentially, a new domain as well. The site name is changing from The Metaweb to the Quicksilver Wiki. I'll post updates on the move [here](/metaweb-site-renaming-patrick-tufts).*

**[Photo annotations on Flickr (Patrick Tufts)](/photo-annotations-on-flickr-patrick-tufts)** by [Patrick Tufts](/user-patrick-tufts), 23 Feb 2006
 *[Flickr](/http-www-flickr-com) user [notlikecalvin](/http-www-flickr-com-photos-notlikecalvin) has made a photoset of [Tower of London](/tower-of-london) locations mentioned in [The System of the World](/stephenson-neal-the-system-of-the-world).

**[Metaweb:Mo' Metaweb (Patrick Tufts)](/metaweb-mo-metaweb-patrick-tufts)** by [Patrick Tufts](/user-patrick-tufts), 3 Oct 2005
*Wanted to give you an update on the site. AMI produced a database backup of the site which several active users are now looking at installing on another machine. There are no guarantees, but there are several efforts to bring this site back up elsewhere. It won't be called the Metaweb, but it will hopefully be running on a more modern version of MediaWiki.*

**[So long, and thanks for all the fish](/metaweb-so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish)** by [Patrick Tufts](/user-patrick-tufts), 13 Sep 2005
*A few years ago, Applied Minds created this site with [User:Neal Stephenson](/user-neal-stephenson) to make a collaboratively edited collection of annotations, initially for Neal's book Quicksilver, and later, for other works as well. We called this site "The Quicksilver Metaweb."*

*More recently, I and my co-workers at Applied Minds have begun a project called "The Metaweb" which bears little resemblance to this site. Applied Minds will soon remove the link from metaweb.com's front page to here. If you wish to reach this site, you will need to use the URL [www.metaweb.com/wiki/wiki.phtml?title=Main\_Page](/http-www-metaweb-com-wiki-wiki-phtml-title-main-page)* ...

*Slashdot readers posed a series of questions to Neal Stephenson to celebrate the completion of the [Baroque Cycle](/baroque-cycle) with the US publication of [The System of the World](/the-system-of-the-world) on September 21, 2004.*[Here are the top ones with Neal's answers.](/http-interviews-slashdot-org-article-pl-sid-04-10-20-1518217-tid-192-tid-214-tid-126-tid-11)

*Metaweb contributor Chris Swingle ([User:Cswingle](/user-cswingle)) has done something particularly neat with the [Quicksilver annotations](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-all-annotations-by-page-number) page. Chris has created a printable PDF of all the Quicksilver annotations. The really cool thing is that it's automatically generated from ...* [more](/metaweb-cool-projects-patrick-tufts)
