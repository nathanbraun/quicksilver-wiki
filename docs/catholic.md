This article refers to the word "Catholic" in the most commonly used sense. See [Catholicism](/catholicism) (disambiguation) for alternate meanings, including those particular to the [Roman Catholic Church](/roman-catholic-church). Catholicism is the name given the oldest of the three main branches of Christianity, and to the beliefs of the [Catholic Church](/catholic-church), usually the Roman Catholic Church, and its adherents. An earlier Webster's Dic. lists two ecclesiastical meanings: "the whole orthodox Christian church, or adherence thereto;" and "the doctrines or faith of the Roman Catholic chuch -- or [Catechism of the Catholic Church](/catechism-of-the-catholic-church), or adherence thereto." 3 The term comes from the Greek katholikos (καθολικος), meaning "universal".
