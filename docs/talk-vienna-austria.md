# Talk:Vienna, Austria

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

It's hard to think of a more pivotal city in the [Baroque](/baroque) period than Vienna. One could almost say that the rise and fall of this city as the world cultural capital pretty much defined that city. It was not until the [Enlightenment](/enlightenment) that the torch passed to [Paris](/paris), and only in the 19th century did Vienna in any sense get it back.

Also it was the place where, notably in [1683](/1683), the [Austro-Hungarian Empire](/austro-hungarian-empire) and [Ottoman Empire](/ottoman-empire) came to blows, and more or less defined the modern map of Europe, ethnically and religiously.

The struggle against the Ottomans and the rise of such trends as [Orientalism](/orientalism), and the demonizing of [Islam](/islam), was intense during this period. It had of course started during the [Crusades](/crusade), which were also marked by attacks on [Jews](/jew) and [Heretics](/heretic) - like the [Cathars](/cathar) who had been wiped out for practicing 20th century hippie Christianity in the 12th century ('-) )
