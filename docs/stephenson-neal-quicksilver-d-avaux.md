(Redirected from [Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:d'Avaux](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver-d-avaux))

D'Avaux was a real historical figure, but just about everything he is described as doing in the Baroque Cycle, is fictitious. Accordingly to the (mostly anti-French) sources I was reading, he was an accomplished intriguer; which is to say that he served his King very effectively.
