N60 is a Nitrogen-60 molecule, a cousin molecule to the Carbon 60 [buckyball](/buckyball) molecule, but which is considered by explosives experts to be the holy grail of chemical explosives, potentially the most energy that can be packed into chemical ionic bonds in as small a volume of space as possible. Such an explosive could come in handy in smuggling into secure locations. As a N60 molecule is stable until detonated, it would likely be near-impossible to detect by sniffing means, leaving only spectral and magnetic scanning methods.

This is likely a widespread explosive in [The Diamond Age](/the-diamond-age) world, given that it should be easy to manufacture in any matter compiler that is either not programmed to block compiling of the chemical, or has been hacked to override such controls. It is also likely a possible explosive in [Skull Gun](/skull-gun) projectiles as well as [Cookie Cutters](/cookie-cutters).
