# Wallace:David:Infinite Jest:Character:Hal Incandenza

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Hal is a major protagonist in the book. 

Son of [Wallace:David:Infinite\_Jest:Character:James Orin Incandenza](/wallace-david-infinite-jest-character-james-orin-incandenza) and [Wallace:David:Infinite\_Jest:Character:Avril Mondragon Incandenza](/wallace-david-infinite-jest-character-avril-mondragon-incandenza), brother to [Wallace:David:Infinite\_Jest:Character:Orin Incandenza](/wallace-david-infinite-jest-character-orin-incandenza) and [Wallace:David:Infinite\_Jest:Character:Mario Incandenza](/wallace-david-infinite-jest-character-mario-incandenza).

The book opens with Hal's interview for admission to college at the University of Arizona, where he is being considered for a tennis scholarship. He suffers from some unstated condition, however, where his attempts at communication appear to his interviewers as spasms or "submammalian" sounds. 

He is involved in the [Wallace:David:Infinite\_Jest:Eschaton](/wallace-david-infinite-jest-eschaton) game.
