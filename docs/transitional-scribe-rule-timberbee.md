# Transitional Scribe Rule (Timberbee)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

Transitional Scribe Rule refers to a Change in, mainly, **Conversion** of Timbers prior to their being added to Layups. It is most evident in the New England States, first showing up sometime in the late 1700's. It precedes  [Square Rule](/square-rule-timberbee) A process first seen in the Very Early 1800's, in a similar Geographic region.

In Transitional Scribe Rule, the areas of the Timbers which were to be joined to one another were often **"Diminished"** in something now reminiscent of Determining the Theoretical Within the Real -- The Basest Description of Square Rule. This seems to have been done to make Scribe Rule a bit faster and Easier, but, in no way more aestheticaly pleasing.

Generaly, Transitional Scribe Rule Structures were, like Square Rule Structures, either House Frames where **None** of the Timbers, other than Cellar and Roof, were visible to the occupants; Or OutBuildings, such as Barns, where beauty was far less an issue.
