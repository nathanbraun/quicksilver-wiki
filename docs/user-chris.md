From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

I'm a  [Neal Stephenson](/user-nealstephenson) fan invited to join by
 [Patrick Tufts](/user-patrick-tufts).

I do research in computer systems. See my page at [http://www.dogfish.org](/http-www-dogfish-org)
if you're curious.

On the off chance that you're enough of a fan to get here, but not enough
of one to have heard of 
[Interface](/http-www-amazon-com-exec-obidos-tg-detail-0553572407),
a book he co-authored under the pseudonym "Stephen Bury", I encourage you 
to take it out for a spin.
