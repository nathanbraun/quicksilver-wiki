# Stephenson:Neal:The System of the World:886:The journey began with a wizard walking into his door (PaulJ)

From the Quicksilver Metaweb.

This is a reference/wink/homage to [Tolkien](/stephenson-neal-cryptonomicon-121-randy-is-a-dwarf-alan-sinder)'s *The hobbit*.

There are plenty of other references to "The Hobbit" in [The System of the World](/the-system-of-the-world), including the ring Daniel is given from [Solomon Kohan](/solomon-kohan) "weighing heavily" in his pocket during a conversation with Newton in the Clubb, and a howitzer gun that is referred to as a "Hobbit" by the author.
