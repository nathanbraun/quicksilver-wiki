Although the Vigenère cipher does not appear in [Quicksilver](/stephenson-neal-quicksilver), it is a famous cipher and appears in [Cryptonomicon](/stephenson-neal-cryptonomicon) in its one-time pad form.

The method of breaking this cipher was independantly discovered by both [Charles Babbage](/charles-babbage) and [Friedrich Wilhelm Kasiski](/), Kasiski publishing his method in 1863, and Babbage's break of the cipher was never published, only written in his notes.
