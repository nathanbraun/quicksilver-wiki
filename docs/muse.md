In Greek mythology, the **Muses** were originally nymphs of springs, then goddesses of song, and, later, of the different kinds of poetry and of the arts and sciences generally. In Homer, they are simply goddesses of song who dwell among the gods on Olympus, where they sing at their banquets under the leadership of Apollo Musagetes. According to Hesiod (Theog. 77), they were the daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne, the personification of memory; others made them children of Uranus and Gaea.
