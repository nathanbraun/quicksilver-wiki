From the Quicksilver Metaweb.


# The Drawing of the Three


The Factions in Timber Framing can be roughly broken down into Three Main "Poles". 
* Mappers
* Bensonites
* Traditionalists


There are great differences between the Factions, and, often, enormous variations within each particular System. Especialy within the Branch referred to as Traditionalists. Though, this last should not be surprising, for, given that "Traditionalist" covers the Entire Breadth and Span of Human History, since Mankind first engaged in shelter building -- of Any kind -- to the mid 1900's, it is an Absolutely Enormous Field.

The Bensonite, and Mapping Pathways, on the other Hand, are the youngest of the Three, Experiencing a Joint Birth in the Early 1970's, Mapping quickly became the Child who stayed Home. While the Bensonite Faction grew, largely identified with the highly visible [Ted Benson](/http-www-bensonwood-com), from whose name it is Derived, who has been supported in Great Measure by, [Ben Brungraber](/http-www-smithsonianmag-si-edu-smithsonian-issues02-apr02-images-timber-ben-brungraber-jpg-html), the Man behind the Scenes.

Though, I acknowledge the name "Bensonite", for this Path -- For it has Often been known as this, throughout the Timber Framing Community -- It must be recognized that Ted Benson has been more of a Spokesman for the Movement, rather than it's True Origniator, and Chief Engineer. Though, I do agree that the Name is largely deserved. Through his books, elements of leadership, and great connection to the pulse of the Tide, Ted's own, ever Evolving Building Practices, and, Popularized Values, have, greatly, mirror the Changing Face of "Modern" Timber Framing Today.


### Traditionalists


Of the Traditionalists there are Two Main Branches, Square Rule, and Scribe Rule. Of these, it was square rule which First practiced, on a large scale, during the Timber Framing Revival in the United States. Currently, There is a great mixture occuring, people who gained their introduction to the World of Timber Framing through Square Rule have been, in great part, also exploring what the Scribe Rule system has to offer them. 

Scribe Rule is, by far, the more sophisticated, and subtle system. It is also, the *Vastly* older of the Two.

Square Rule is Uniquely American in Orgin. First Appearing in the North Eastern United in the Very Early 1800's -- the earliest example to date has been 1805. Inklings of a system emerging are seen in what is called, "Transitional" Scribe Rule, which is a modification of Traditional Scribe Rule techniques. One of the key, identifying, features of this "Transitional" system is the appearance of "Housings", or "Flats", cut into the scribed pieces. These Housings would mirror one of the Key Elements of Square Rule; the presence of a Theoretical Timber within the "Real" Timber, which is the Heart and Sould of Square Rule.

Transitional Scribe Rule can be seen, scattered, throughout New England Structures from the 1770's on.

One of the Key Points, which **May** be driving the broadening of the "Traditionalist" movement in the United States, is that Square Rule was a system which was **Never** meant to be visible, except in Barn, or other Utilitarian structures. House Frames, **Important** Frames, were buried. This is not so, today. The Frame, within the House, School, Church, or, Civic Structure, is no longer meant to be denied to the eye. We are Now on display.

That Square Rule can offer Aesthetic Appeal is evidenced by the many beautiful frames which exist, Today. But, it is true that it is often the Artistry the individual Builder brings to their craft which makes this happen, rather than from the inevitable flowing of the system.

Square Rule was simply meant to be a Purely Practical, Utilitarian, Time-Saving, Labor Sparing System of Layout, And it more than achieved this. There is a great deal of pride, that this system is, American.

There was, a number of years ago, a new system of Square Rule struggling to emerge, "Precision Square Rule". It had a large number of prefaces, depending on who, at the time, was promoting it. A system I was accused of being involved with. I was not. Though, I will say, that it, like the Bensonite Movement as a whole, is the spontaneous expression of a body of craftsmen. In this case, they are struggling for a system which Speaks, communicates, from the Heart,what they, as a Body, are unconciously seeking, something which Square Rule is no longer able to offer them.

One of the "Radical" aspects of this "Precision" Square Rule is that it utilizes Housings on both the Reference **And** the Non-Reference Faces. This is Radical on two points. The first is that Traditionaly, Square Rule Only has housings on the Non-Referene faces. There is No reason, whatsoever, in square rule to have housings on the Reference face of a timber *Unless* it is called for Structurally.

The Second Reason it is Radical is that... Well, Square Rule **Allows** for housings to be placed, Anywhere. Absolutely No modification of the Traditional system is needed to enable this. So, the question is, Why?

As a connected phenomenon, a large number of those who had *Vocalized*, the need, and the Practice of, this "New" Square Rule, were already becoming disillusioned by it, and were, in very large part, gravitating towards Scribe Rule.

One factor to consider, in the late 1980's, When many of the New Generation, the **Third** Generation, of Traditionalists were coming of Age Scribe Rule was not an option. It was little practiced, and little Known in the United States. This has changed enormously. Today, a Traditionalist is Almost expected to have a grounding in both Square Rule *And* Scribe Rule. 

Square Rule **Is** the easier of the two, thus, with the chance for Equal exposure, the "Challenge" lies with Scribe Rule. The Only "Challenge" Square Rule now offers is in the Great, Artistic Effort in attempting to Duplicate what Scribe Rule so Effortlessly achieves; Aesthetic Harmony.
