**Charles Lutwidge Dodgson** ([January 27](/), [1832](/) – [January 14](/), [1898](/)), better known by the [pen name](/) **Lewis Carroll**, was a [British](/) [author](/), [mathematician](/), [Anglican](/) clergyman, [logician](/), and amateur [photographer](/).

His most famous writings are *[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland](/)* and its sequel *[Through the Looking-Glass](/)*, as well as the comic poem *[The Hunting of the Snark](/)*. He also wrote many short pieces, including *[Euclid and his Modern Rivals](/)* and *[The Alphabet Cipher](/)*. 

His facility at [word play](/), [logic](/), and [fantasy](/) has delighted audiences ranging from the most naïve to the most sophisticated. His works have remained popular since they were published and have influenced not only [children's literature](/), but also a number of major 20th century writers such as [James Joyce](/) and [Jorge Luis Borges](/).

### Upbringing


Dodgson's family was predominantly northern [English](/), with some [Irish](/) connections. Conservative and High Church [Anglican](/), most of Dodgson's ancestors belonged the two traditional English upper-middle class professions: the army and the [Church](/). His great-grandfather, also Charles Dodgson, had risen through the ranks of the church to become a [bishop](/); his grandfather, another Charles, had been an [army](/) [captain](/), killed in action in [1803](/) while his two sons were hardly more than babies.

The elder of these—yet another Charles—reverted to the other family business and took holy orders. He went to [Westminster School](/), and thence to [Christ Church, Oxford](/). He was [mathematically](/mathematics) gifted and won a double first degree which could have been the prelude to a brilliant academic career. Instead he married his cousin in 1827 and retired into obscurity as a country parson.

Young Charles was born in the little [parsonage](/) of [Daresbury](/) in [Cheshire](/), the oldest boy but already the third child of the four-and-a-half year old marriage. Eight more were to follow and, incredibly for the time, all of them—seven girls and four boys— survived into adulthood. When Charles was 11 his father was given the living of [Croft-on-Tees](/) in north [Yorkshire](/), and the whole family moved to the spacious Rectory. This remained their home for the next 25 years. 

Dodgson senior made some progress through the ranks of the church: he published some sermons, translated [Tertullian](/), became an Archdeacon of [Ripon Cathedral](/), and involved himself, sometimes influentially, in the intense religious disputes that were dividing the Anglican church. He was High Church, inclining to [Anglo-Catholicism](/), an admirer of [Newman](/) and the [Tractarian movement](/), and he did his best to instill such views in his children.

Young Charles grew out of infancy into a bright, articulate boy. In the early years he was educated at home. His "reading lists" preserved in the family testify to a precocious intellect: at the age of seven the child was reading The [Pilgrim's Progress](/). It is often said that he was naturally left-handed and suffered severe psychological trauma by being forced to counteract this tendency, but there is no documentary evidence to support this. At twelve he was sent away to a small private school at nearby Richmond, where he appears to have been happy and settled. But in [1845](/), young Dodgson moved on to [Rugby School](/), where he was evidently less happy, for as he wrote some years after leaving the place:

*I cannot say ... that any earthly considerations would induce me to go through my three years again ... I can honestly say that if I could have been ... secure from annoyance at night, the hardships of the daily life would have been comparative trifles to bear.*

The nature of this nocturnal 'annoyance' will probably never now be fully understood, but it may be that he is delicately referring to some form of sexual abuse. Scholastically, though, he excelled with apparent ease. "I have not had a more promising boy his age since I came to Rugby" observed R.B. Mayor, the Maths master.

### Academics


He left Rugby at the end of [1850](/) and, after an interval which remains unexplained, went on in January [1851](/) to [Oxford](/): to his father's old college, [Christ Church](/). He had only been at Oxford two days when he received a summons home. His mother had died of "inflammation of the brain"—perhaps [meningitis](/) or a stroke—at the age of forty-seven.

Whatever Dodgson's feelings may have been about this death, he did not allow them to distract him too much from his purpose at Oxford. He may not always have worked hard, but he was exceptionally gifted and achievement came easily to him. The following year he received a first in Honour Moderations, and shortly after he was nominated to a Studentship (the Christ Church equivalent of a fellowship), by his father's old friend Canon [Edward Pusey](/).

His early academic career veered between high-octane promise and irresistible distraction. Through his own laziness, he failed an important scholarship, but still his clear brilliance as a mathematician won him the Christ Church Mathematical Lectureship, which he continued to hold for the next 26 years. The income was good, but the work bored him. Many of his pupils were stupid as well as older and richer than he was, and almost all of them were disinterested. They didn't want to be taught, he didn't want to teach them. Mutual apathy ruled.

### Photography

**Alice Liddell as photographed  
by Lewis Carroll in 1859**In [1856](/), Dodgson took up the new art form of [photography](/). He excelled at it and it became an expression of his very personal inner philosophy; a belief in the divinity of what he called [beauty](/), by which he seemed to mean a state of moral or aesthetic or physical perfection. He found this divine beauty not simply in the magic of theatre, but in the poetry of words, in a mathematical formula; and perhaps supremely, in the human form; in the body-images that moved him.

When he took up photography he sought with his own representations to combine the ideals of freedom and beauty into the innocence of [Eden](/), where the human body and human contact could be enjoyed without shame. In his [middle age|middle age](/), he was to re-form this philosophy into the pursuit of beauty as a state of Grace, a means of retrieving lost innocence. This, along with his lifelong passion for the theatre, was to bring him into confrontation with [Victorian morality](/) and his own family's High Church beliefs. 

His favorite subjects for photography were portraits of famous persons, such as [Ellen Terry](/), [Dante Gabriel Rossetti](/), and [Alfred, Lord Tennyson](/), as well as little girls and older females, both with and without clothing. Dodgson either destroyed or returned the nude photographs to the families of the girls he'd photographed. They were long presumed lost, but four nudes have surfaced.

Dodgson's practice of photographing or sketching nude girls has led to speculation that he was a [paedophile](/), see below.

### Character


The young adult Charles Dodgson was about six foot tall, slender and handsome in a soft-focused dreamy sort of way, with curling brown hair and blue eyes. At the unusually late age of seventeen he suffered a severe attack of [whooping cough](/) which left him with poor hearing in his right ear and was probably responsible for his chronically weak chest in later life, but the only overt defect he carried into adulthood was what he referred to as his "hesitation"—a [stammer](/) he had acquired in early childhood and which was to plague him throughout his entire life. 

The stammer has always been a potent part of the myth. It is part of the mythology that Carroll only stammered in adult company, and was free and fluent with children, but there is nothing to support this idea. Many children of his acquaintance remembered the stammer; many adults failed to notice it. It came and went for its own reasons, but not as a clichéd manifestation of fear of the adult world. Dodgson himself was far more acutely aware of it than most people he met. Although his stammer troubled him — even obsessed him sometimes — it was never bad enough to stop him using his other qualities to do well in society. 

He was naturally gregarious and egoistic enough to relish attention and admiration. At a time when people devised their own amusements, when singing and recitation were required social skills, the young Dodgson was well-equipped as an engaging entertainer. He could sing tolerably well and was not afraid to do so in front of an audience. He was adept at mimicry and story-telling. He was reputedly quite good at [charades](/). 

There are brief hints at a soaring sense of the spiritual and the divine; small moments that reveal a rich and intensely-lived inner life. 'That is a wild and beautiful bit of poetry, the song of "call the cattle home",' he suddenly observed, in the midst of an analysis of [Charles Kingsley](/)'s novel *[Alton Locke](/)*:

*I remember hearing it sung at Albrighton: I wonder if any one there could have entered into the spirit of Alton Locke. I think not. I think the character of most that I meet is merely refined animal... How few seem to care for the only subjects of real interest in life.*

He was also quite socially ambitious, anxious to make his mark on the world in some way, as a writer, as an artist. His scholastic career was only a stop-gap to other more exciting attainments that he desired.

### Writing career


During his academic career, Carroll wrote [poetry](/) and [short stories](/), sending them to various magazines and already enjoying moderate success. Between [1854](/) and [1856](/), his work appeared in the national publications, *The Comic Times* and The Train, as well as smaller magazines like the *[Whitby Gazette](/)* and the *Oxford Critic*.

Most of his output was funny, sometimes [satirical](/). But his standards and his ambitions were exacting. "I do not think I have yet written anything worthy of real publication (in which I do not include the *Whitby Gazette* or the *Oxonian Advertiser*), but I do not despair of doing so some day," he wrote in July [1855](/). Years before Alice, he was thinking up ideas for children's books that would make money: 'Christmas book [that would] sell well... Practical hints for constructing Marionettes and a theatre'. The ideas got better as he got older, but his canny mind, with an eye to income, was always there. 

In [1856](/) he published his first piece of work under the name that would make him famous. A very predictable little romantic poem called "Solitude" appeared in the Train under the authorship of 'Lewis Carroll'. This pseudonym was a play on his real name, *Lewis* being the anglicised form of *Ludovicus*, which was the Latin for *Lutwidge*, and *Carroll* being an [anglicised](/) version of *Carolus*, the Latin for *Charles*.

In the same year, a new Dean, [Henry Liddell](/), arrived at Christ Church, bringing with him a young wife and children, all of whom would figure largely in Dodgson's life over the following years. He became close friends with the mother and the children, particularly the three sisters Ina, [Alice](/) and Edith. It seems there became something of a tradition of his taking the girls out on the river for picnics at [Godstow](/) or [Nuneham](/).

It was on one such expedition, in [1862](/), that Dodgson invented the outline of the story that eventually became his first and largest commercial success — the first Alice book. Having told the story and been begged by Alice Liddell to write it down, Dodgson was evidently struck by its potential to sell well. He took the manuscript — at this stage titled *Alice's Adventures Under Ground* — to Macmillan the publisher, who liked it immediately. After the possible alternative titles *Alice Among the Fairies* and *Alice's Golden Hour* were rejected, the work was finally published as *[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland](/)* in [1865](/) under the Lewis Carroll pen-name Dodgson had first used some nine years earlier. 

With the immediate, phenomenal success of Alice, the story of the author's life becomes effectively divided in two: the continuing story of Dodgson's real life and the evolving myth surrounding "Lewis Carroll." Carroll quickly became a rich and detailed [alter ego](/), a persona as famous and deeply embedded in the popular psyche as the story he told. To him belongs a large part of the image of little girls and strange otherworldliness that we know from the author of Alice. 

It is undisputed that throughout his growing wealth and fame, he continued to teach at Christ Church until [1881](/), and that he remained in residence there until his death. He published *Through the Looking-Glass and what Alice Found There* in [1872](/); his great Joycean mock-epic *The Hunting of the Snark*, in [1876](/), and his last novel, the two-volume *[Sylvie and Bruno](/)*, in [1889](/) and [1893](/) respectively. He also published many mathematical papers under his own name, courted scandal through his associations with women, toured [Russia](/) and [Europe](/) on an extended visit (in [1867](/)) and bought a house in [Guildford](/), where he died suddenly of violent [pneumonia](/) on January 14, 1898, leaving mystery and enigma behind him.

### Allegations of paedophilia


Dodgsons undeniable fondness for children — and especially his photographs of nude or semi-nude girls, and his sketchbooks featuring his own drawings of nude or seminude girls — have led to speculation that he was a [paedophile](/). 

The issue has been contentious, with some noting that there is no evidence that Dodgson abused girls, or arguing that child nudes were not uncommon during the era. (Other notable Victorian-era photographers who took images of nude children include [Julia Margaret Cameron](/) and [Francis Meadow Sutcliffe](/), [Oscar Rejlander](/), and indeed almost any notable photographic artist of the time.)

The first hints of allegations that Dodgson was a paedophile seem to have appeared in [1932](/), in *The Life of Lewis Carroll* by [Langford Reed](/). Reed apparently was the first to claim that all of Carroll's female friendships ended when the girls reached [puberty](/), though Reed apparently only intended to suggest that Dodgson was therby a pure man untainted by touch of lust for adult flesh. This claim that Dodgson lost interest in girls once they reached puberty was later caught up by other biographers, who remained unaware of the evidence to the contrary since Dodgson's family refused to publish his diaries and letters. 

The view of Dodgson as having no adult life and being preoccupied with children persisted among his biographers, including [Florence Becker Lennon](/) (*Victoria Through the Looking-Glass* [UK title *Lewis Carroll*], [1945](/)) and the highly influential [Alexander Taylor](/) (*The White Knight*, [1952](/)). The debate tended to veer between those who believed Dodgson to have been innocently obsessed with children and those who believed this obsession to have been paedophilic. 

The issue was rekindled in [1995](/) with *Lewis Carroll, a Biography* by [Morton Cohen](/), which deals with the issue much in the line of *The White Knight* by Alexander Taylor. Cohen writes: We cannot know to what extent sexual urges lay behind Charless preference for drawing and photographing children in the nude. He contended the preference was entirely [aesthetic](/). But given his emotional attachment to children as well as his aesthetic appreciation of their forms, his assertion that his interest was strictly artistic is naïve. He probably felt more than he dared acknowledge, even to himself. Certainly he always sought to have another adult present when nude prepubescent modeled for him. Cohen notes that the childrens mothers were encouraged to be present, and asks if these precautions were the result of Dodgson insuring himself against slipups. (p 228–229) Cohen concedes that Dodgson apparently convinced many of his friends that his attachment to the nude female child form was free of any [eroticism](/), but adds that later generations look beneath the surface (p 229).

A new analysis in [Karoline Leach](/)'s [1999](/) book, *In the Shadow of the Dreamchild*, claims that the image of Dodgson's alleged paedophilia was built out of a failure to understand Victorian mores as well as the mistaken idea that Dodgson had no interest in adult women which evolved out of the minds of various biographers. According to Leach, Dodgson's real life was very different from the accepted biographical image. He in fact was keenly interested in adult women and enjoyed several relationships with women, married and single. Suggestions of paedophilia only evolved many years after his death, when his well-meaning family had suppressed all evidence of his adult friendships in order to try to preserve his reputation, thus giving a false impression of a man only interested in little girls.

Dodgson's problems with societal disapproval, Leach says, stemmed not from his usage of nude child models but his attempts to get older models to pose in 'bathing dress' and other immodest clothing. These studies of scantily-dressed older models have all disappeared, leaving commentators only the photos of young girls to comment on. 

The only recorded instance of trouble associated with the nudes of children was Dodgson's experience with the Mayhew family. In [1879](/), Dodgson wrote what have been called by Cohen "several curious letters ... to the family of Andrew Mayhew, an Oxford colleague ... He asked permission to take nude photographs of the three Mayhew daughters, ages 6, 11, and 13, with no other adults present." The Mayhew parents, who had previously allowed Dodgson to photograph their children, refused, and Cohen notes this same period saw a "sudden break in the friendship" between Dodgson and the Mayhew family (p. 170). Leach suggests that the problem lay with his desire to study the older daughters in frontal positions and not with the younger children. 

### Jack the Ripper theories


In [1996](/) author [Richard Wallace](/) published a book titled *[Jack the Ripper, Light-Hearted Friend](/)* accusing Lewis Carroll and his colleague [Thomas Vere Bayne](/) of being [Jack the Ripper](/). It was largely based upon [anagrams](/) Wallace constructed from Carroll's writing. Carroll and Bayne have strong alibis for most of the nights of the Ripper murders, and Wallace's theory has not found support from other scholars. For more information, see the *[Jack the Ripper, Light-Hearted Friend](/)* article.

Carroll did show some interest in the Jack the Ripper case, however; this is hardly unusual, given the profound publicity surrounding the crimes. A passage in his [diary](/) dated [August 26](/), [1891](/), reports that he spoke that day with an acquaintance of his about his "very ingenious theory about 'Jack the Ripper'". No other information about this theory has been found.
